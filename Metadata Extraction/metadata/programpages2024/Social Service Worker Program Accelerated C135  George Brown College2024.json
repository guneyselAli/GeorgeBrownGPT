      "Quote": "So much has happened since I left GBC. I got a job at a community centre right after I finished the program and I am now having my placement at Scarborough Women's Centre, And last week I signed a contract with a group practice that is specialized in psychotherapy for queer clients. I got registered as an RSSW, got liability insurance, have a supervisor working with me.!!! The only reason why this is all possible is that I have an SSW diploma. I am so happy, and I did not expect to be where I am so quickly. I am still one year away from being an MSW, but I am already doing the work I wanted. GBC was an important piece in all of this.”\n}\n}"

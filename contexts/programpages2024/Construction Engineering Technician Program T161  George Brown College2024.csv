2c237e68-f289-449d-b54c-895e9c2d16fb," The Angelo DelZotto School of Construction Management offers a construction technology program with field education and experiential learning opportunities. Graduates can enter various careers in the construction industry such as construction technicians, site managers, project and construction managers, estimators, home builders, general contractors, building and home inspectors, and technical sales agents. They may also start their own businesses. The construction industry generates over 360,000 jobs and pays more than $22 billion in wages in Ontario alone. In Toronto, there is a high demand for housing due to population growth and expanding transit networks, leading to significant construction activity. The School of Construction Management has an active Program Advisory Committee that contributes ideas and opinions on curriculum changes and industry trends. Students can continue to the third year of the Construction Engineering Technology Program for an Advanced Diploma or transfer to the Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) degree program after completing three years in the construction technology program, with a minimum GPA of 3.0 required.

Required courses for semester 1 include BLDG 1025 - Surveying for Construction Technology, BLDG 1042 - Construction Materials Methods 1, BLDG 1126 - Print and Specifications Reading for Construction Technology 1, and BLDG 1127 - Construction Management 1. However, please note that the program is undergoing current review and courses after year 1 are expected to change in the 2023-24 year.

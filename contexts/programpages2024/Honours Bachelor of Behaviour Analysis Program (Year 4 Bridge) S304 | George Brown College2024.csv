Students who complete this program will undergo a bridge semester (January - April), followed by an unpaid internship (September - December), and finish with the final term, Semester 8 (January - April). The primary focus of the program is Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), which is a scientific approach to understanding and modifying human behavior.

ABA is used to treat various populations, including individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), brain injury, dementia, developmental disabilities, addiction, and mental health disorders. Students will gain comprehensive knowledge of behavioral psychology and ABA throughout the program.

The program consists of three main components:
1. Conducting a complete behavioral assessment.
2. Developing an effective plan based on the assessment results.
3. Ongoing evaluation of the first two components.

Students will also be required to undertake a research component, which includes preparing an Applied Research Proposal prior to conducting their research during the fall internship (September - December) and writing a research thesis before graduating. The Association for Behaviour Analysis International has verified specific courses in the program towards its coursework requirements.

9bade66b-e587-4ea8-ae90-953eb97cc384," The text provides information about a nursing program offered by George Brown College focused on Operating Room Perioperative Nursing. The course is delivered through multimodal learning with both in-class and online components, including synchronous and asynchronous sessions, lab skills and simulations, and a clinical practical experience.

The first phase of the program, Nursing 4045, lasts for five weeks where students learn about ORNAC standards, surgical anatomy and instrumentation, surgical interventions and technologies, roles of scrub and circulating nurses, and lab skills. The second phase, Nursing 4046, is a clinical practicum lasting eight weeks (320 hours) where students consolidate their theory knowledge and develop the scrub and circulating nurse roles while gaining exposure to various surgical specialties. Students may participate in online discussions during their clinical placement through live video conferences and complete clinical assignments as per the course syllabus. Clinical experiences are coordinated by the program coordinator at hospitals within or outside the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), or at the hospital where the student is employed.

It's essential to note that students must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to complete their clinical placements and meet course requirements. The text also mentions career and postgraduate study opportunities for those who complete this program, but no further details about these pathways are provided in the text.",scraped_pages/programpages2024/Registered Nurse – Operating Room Perioperative Nursing Program (Postgraduate) S414 | George Brown College2024.txt

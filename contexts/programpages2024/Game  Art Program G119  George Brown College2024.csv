2a07ebb2-c14d-486c-9cc3-7b346dae9131," This text describes a game development program offered by a college. The program lasts for two years and students can choose to specialize in game modelling or game animation in their second year. Students are required to create a portfolio/demo of their work before graduating, which will showcase their skills in game development and highlight their area of specialization.

Students with approved portfolios may be eligible for external field placements in semesters 5 and 6. Graduates of the program can look forward to careers in various game and digital media studios, including roles in character art, 2D environment art, 3D environment art, 3D modelling, 3D animation, character modelling, level design, cinematic animation, special effects, texture design, user interface design, and quality assurance.

Graduates may be eligible for admission into George Brown postgraduate programs, and students who successfully complete the program with a grade point average of 3.0 or higher may be eligible for direct admission into the Game Design program.

The required courses for the first year include Drawing I, 2D Digital Art I, Introduction to Modelling, Interactive Prototyping I, Drawing II, 2D Digital Art II, Introduction to Animation, Interactive Prototyping II, Studio Lab 1, Communicating Across Contexts, Environment Modelling I, Game Art and Architecture I, Level Design I, and Ludology and Game History.

The text also mentions the prerequisites for each course. For example, Drawing I has no prerequisite, but Drawing II requires a completion of Drawing I. Some courses require specific other courses to be completed as well, such as Environment Modelling I requiring 2D Digital Art I and 2015.

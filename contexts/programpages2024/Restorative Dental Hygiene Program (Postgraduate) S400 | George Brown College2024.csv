1705997132606695000," The full-time, hybrid Dental Hygiene program at the college is OSAP eligible. To be eligible for this program, one must be actively registered to practise dental hygiene with the College of Dental Hygienists of Ontario (CDHO) and have a minimum of one year of dental hygiene work experience. Upon completion of the program, graduates can apply to the CDHO for designation without requiring additional national competency exams.

The program covers various procedures including applying bonding systems and liners, placing and finishing composite and amalgam restorations, taking final impressions, fabricating and cementing provisional restorations, and cementing and bonding indirect restorations. Students learn these skills in coordination with Dental Technology, Denturism, and Dental Assisting students. Practical experience takes place at the on-site WAVE Dental Clinic where students perform restorative and cosmetic procedures on clients.

Interested graduates can further their careers by applying for the Honours Bachelor of Science (Dental Hygiene) online degree completion program, which is the first of its kind in Ontario. Students will earn a degree focused on subject matter specific to Dental Hygiene in just three semesters.

In semester 1, students focus on developing pre-clinical placement skills and practise restorative skills exclusively on manikins. In semester 2, they get hands-on experience performing restorative procedures with clients at the nearly 40,000 square foot WAVE Dental Clinic under the supervision of qualified oral health-care professionals. Observation of a restorative dental hygienist also takes place off-site with their current employer and/or community field placement partners upon approval by faculty.

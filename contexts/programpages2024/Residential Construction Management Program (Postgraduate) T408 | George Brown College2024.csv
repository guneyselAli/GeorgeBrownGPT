The program provides extensive industry exposure and experience through limited class sizes, increased access to lab facilities and instructor interaction, and a four-month field placement at a RESCON member firm. After graduating, students can take on entry-level roles in the residential construction sector such as estimator, residential construction manager, residential construction project manager, site superintendent, or project coordinator.

The program was launched in 2013 and has since successfully prepared graduates for the residential sector, both low-rise and high-rise. It consists of two semesters with required courses such as Quality Control & Defect Prevention (BLDG 4011), Home Design & Value Engineering (BLDG 4012), Purchasing and Bid Processes (BLDG 4013), Residential Construction Project Management (BLDG 4014), and High-Rise Residential Construction (BLDG 4015). In the second semester, students complete a four-month field placement.

The program learning outcomes include the ability to assess requirements for construction industry business planning and management, formulate strategies for human resource planning and management, analyze and explain building codes and legal issues including contract law, and assess safe work practices and risk analysis and management theory. The program is continuously reviewed and adjusted to meet the needs of the construction industry.",scraped_pages/programpages2024/Residential Construction Management Program (Postgraduate) T408 | George Brown College2024.txt

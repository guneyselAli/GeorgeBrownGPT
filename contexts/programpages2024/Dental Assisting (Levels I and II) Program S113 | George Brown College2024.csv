Graduates of this program are eligible to apply to write the National Dental Assisting Examining Board (NDAEB) examination and, upon successful completion, can apply for certification with the Ontario Dental Assistants Association to work as a Level II dental assistant in Ontario.

Field education sites include private dental practices, public health units, and teaching hospitals. Students have the opportunity to collaborate with one of the 12 George Brown College Child Care Centers to teach oral health education.

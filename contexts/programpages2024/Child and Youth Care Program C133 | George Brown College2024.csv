1705971360206911000," The Child and Youth Care program at the college focuses on recognizing the impact of mental health challenges on children and youth, and designing programs to support them and their families. Students learn to translate theory into practice to help youth move from potential risk to resilience.

During the first year, students will learn foundational skills, and in the second and third years, they will gain practical experience with supervised field placements. Placements may take place in professional settings such as residential care, hospitals, shelters, schools, after-school programs, community outreach programs, day treatment, and youth justice. Students are expected to work both day and evening shifts, and may be requested to work on some weekends.

Second-year students will be in placement two days a week during the winter semester, while third-year students will be in placement three days a week over 28 weeks, including both the fall and winter semesters. To proceed to field placement, students must pass the prerequisite CYCS 1015 – Field Preparation Seminar, and they are required to enroll and pass both Field Placement and Field Seminar courses, which are co-requisites. Second-year placement is a prerequisite for third-year placement, and the passing grade for all field-related courses is 60 per cent.

Graduates of the Child and Youth Care program have found employment in treatment centers, group homes/residential placements, hospitals, educational settings, community-based treatment programs, shelters, and youth justice.",scraped_pages/programpages2024/Child and Youth Care Program C133 | George Brown College2024.txt

The process can take between two to three months but may take up to eight months. Students are responsible for ensuring the check covers appropriateness for working with vulnerable persons, and they must keep the original copy. Failure to provide a clear Vulnerable Sector Check will prevent students from starting their placement and completing the program. The fees for the vulnerable sector check vary, and more information can be found on the Clinical Pre-placement website.

Domestic students should apply through Ontario Colleges, while international students should apply through the George Brown College Online Application System. For more information about the Child & Youth Care Program, contact Judy Masters (jmasters@georgebrown.ca) or Zalina Mohamad.

Students who cannot fulfill medical pre-requirements or do not complete mandatory health forms may jeopardize their academic standing and successful completion of the program. All associated costs are the responsibility of the student, including service fees and fines for overall health requirements. To download the Pre-placement health form and access more details, visit the Clinical Pre-placement website. Students who do not fulfill medical pre-requirements should speak with their program coordinators to find a suitable placement option. Vulnerable Sector Check requirements and policies must be renewed every year.

Additionally, students in this program are required to have a Vulnerable Sector Check for compliance with the requirements of their placement partners. The clients of these partner agencies are considered ""vulnerable persons"" under the law, and this check is required to protect them. Students who cannot provide a clear Vulnernerable Sector Check will not be able to start their field or clinical placements and may jeopardize their progress in the program. Our agency partners have the final decision for students being allowed to practice in their agencies. Failure to meet the requirements for field placement can prevent students from completing the program and securing employment.

The fees for the Vulnerable Sector Check vary, and more information on how and when to apply can be found by visiting the Clinical Pre-placement website or contacting the School of Social & Community Services at communityservices@georgebrown.ca.",scraped_pages/programpages2024/Child and Youth Care Program C133 | George Brown College2024.txt

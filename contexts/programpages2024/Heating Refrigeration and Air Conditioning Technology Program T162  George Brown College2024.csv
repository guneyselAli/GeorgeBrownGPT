05dcb97a-b784-41c1-9199-fd7daf6c2811," This advanced diploma program at George Brown College focuses on the heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC/R) industry. In the first two years, students learn about residential and some light commercial systems, with the third year dedicated to commercial systems. The curriculum covers the theory of air and hydronic systems for designing distribution systems and selecting appropriate fans, pumps, heating and cooling systems, and controls for larger buildings.

The program adheres to industry-standard design practices for environmentally responsible and energy-efficient residential, commercial, and industrial systems as established by HRAI, ASHRAE, and the Canada Green Building Council.

Upon completion of this program, graduates can challenge the Gas Fitter 2 provincial qualification exam and obtain certification if they achieve a passing grade of 75%. In semester 3, students are assisted in preparing to challenge the Ontario Ministry of Consumer Affairs and Housing HVAC House exam, which, when passed with a score of 75%, can be used toward obtaining a Building Code Identification Number (BCIN).

Graduates may find employment opportunities in consulting engineering and architectural firms, design/build contractors, school boards, commercial refrigeration installation and maintenance companies, building automation and control companies, building maintenance, HVAC/R manufacturing, sales, and distribution companies. They may also pursue management careers in the mechanical sector of the construction industry or become self-employed specialty contractors.

Required courses for semester 1 include: BLDG 1086 – Building Science and Green Technologies, and HVAC 1001 – Refracement Systems Fundamentals.","scraped_pages/programpages2024/Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Technology Program T162 | George Brown College2024.txt"

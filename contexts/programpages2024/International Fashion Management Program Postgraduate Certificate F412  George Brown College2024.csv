Testimonial: ""The Post Graduate International Fashion Management program is excellent for someone looking to launch a career in the apparel industry. The curriculum helps you to understand the business side of fashion, from understanding the trade between countries and their applicable laws or getting a glimpse of the supply chain. The program challenges you to be ready for all real-life scenarios through live case studies provided by industry-active professors. I strongly recommend this program to those who want to truly understand the business side, which is an indispensable factor in making money out of your creativity. The program offers numerous career-building opportunities; however, I would recommend sticking to what you like and work towards that. The mandatory internship goes hand-in-hand and makes you understand how the Canadian fashion industry works and brings you one step closer to beginning your career. I wish future students all the very best and look forward to seeing them working in the industry with excellence after graduation from this program!"" - Pushpreet Singh, Ontario College Graduate Certificate

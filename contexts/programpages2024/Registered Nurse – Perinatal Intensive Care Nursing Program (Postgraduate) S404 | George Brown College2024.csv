1705973820289570000," The George Brown College offers two learning streams for its Registered Nurse – Perinatal Intensive Care Nursing program: a Standard learning stream and an Accelerated learning stream. Both streams last for 15 weeks and are offered in September and January.

The Standard learning stream is designed for registered nurses who have no current experience in neonatal nursing. Students attend synchronous-learning classes three full days per week, with lectures, case studies, and expert guest speakers making up the theoretical component. Completion of two clinical courses is mandatory.

The Accelerated learning stream is intended for nurses with at least one year of current experience caring for neonates, typically in a Level II or III NICU. Online interactive classes occur twice a week for discussion and facilitation of learning of the theoretical concepts. Students must undergo a successful application of Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR) process for their NICU experience to receive credit for one or both clinical courses within the Perinatal program.

All students use a theory manual and a textbook, and faculty are available for support via class, online meeting platforms or email, telephone, and tutorial support. Clinical courses take place in Level II and/or Level III neonatal intensive care units. The program requires students to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to complete clinical placements.

Students will have opportunities to practice through simulation and in-person experiences in the classroom. This program does not prepare students to be ASL-English Interpreters, Deaf Culture Instructors, or ASL Instructors. Graduates of this program may apply to the Honours Bachelor of Interpretation (American Sign Language – English) (C302) program at George Brown College or similar programs at other colleges if they wish to become American Sign Language-English Interpreters.

Career opportunities for individuals with ASL skills include health-care, business, educational and social service settings. Fluency in ASL is an asset for anyone who interacts with members of the Deaf community or the general public. To broaden employment prospects, students can combine this ASL certificate program with early childhood education, teaching, nursing, counselling, communications and law, other diplomas and degrees.

1705974545533603000," The George Brown College offers a Health Information Management program that focuses on classification systems and coding, data collection, statistical analysis and presentation, health-care legislation, and the transition from paper to electronic health records. Students will develop, implement, and maintain health information systems while protecting patient information and promoting confidentiality awareness. They will also control the release of medico-legal information and evaluate standards of documentation. Graduates are eligible to write the Canadian Health Information Management Association national certification examination. Students are required to bring their own laptop computers for the duration of the program.

Field placement, an essential component of the program, is integrated throughout semesters 3 and 4 with students visiting partner offices every Friday until the end of semester 4. They will be exposed to various components of health data and complete a project related to health data during a three-week block placement at the end of semester 4. Sites for field experiences include healthcare facilities, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, health-related insurance companies, the Ontario Hospital Association, and community care access centers. Some clinical or work placement partners may require students to show proof of full vaccination against COVID-19.

Graduates can expect to find employment opportunities as Health Information Management practitioners within the healthcare community, working closely with other health-care professionals to manage health information and contribute to quality care. Career options include, but are not limited to, health data analysis, health information system management, privacy and security, documentation evaluation, and clinical research.

Please note that more information about the certification exam fee can be found on the Canadian Health Information Management Association website.

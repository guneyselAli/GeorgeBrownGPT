1705985335221225000," Students in the program are required to submit program specific requirements by the established deadlines on the ParaMed Placement Pass website. They must also be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and have a completed Vulnerable Sector Check, which must be renewed every year before clinical placement. The health policies and non-academic requirements are designed to protect vulnerable populations. Students who do not comply with these requirements or who do not submit all required documentation by deadlines may be excluded from clinical practicum, which could jeopardize their academic standing and successful completion of the program. The costs associated with the overall health requirements are the responsibility of the student. To download the mandatory Pre-placement health form and for more details on the Vulnerable Sector Check process, students should go to the Clinical Pre-placement website. All clinical placement partners require a completed Vulnerable Sector Check for students, and students who cannot provide a clear check will not be able to start their field or clinical placement and will therefore be unable to complete the program. The Vulnerable Sector Check process typically takes two to three months but can take four to eight months.",scraped_pages/programpages2024/Registered Nurse – Critical Care Nursing Program (Postgraduate) S402 | George Brown College2024.txt

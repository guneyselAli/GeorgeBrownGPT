c7923759-0474-493e-b422-8d6983cc3439," The text provides information about different types of welding processes taught in a college program, which includes Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW), Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), Plasma Arc and Oxyfuel Cutting, and Fabrication. SMAW uses a consumable electrode covered with flux, is primary in maintenance and repair industry, used for welding iron and steel, and can also be used for alloys. GMAW uses electricity to melt and join pieces of metal together, is easy to learn, and can be used to weld various metals such as carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, magnesium, copper, bronze, etc. GTAW uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode with inert gas protection for welding stainless steel and non-ferrous metals like aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. Plasma Arc and Oxyfuel Cutting use compressed gas or fuel gases combined with oxygen to cut metals primarily mild steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. Fabrication is the building of metal structures by cutting, bending, and assembling processes.

Graduates of the program have increased marketability and knowledge of the welding trade and provide a good understanding of safety practices relevant to the work performed. Welders are always in demand in the manufacturing industry of Ontario due to their importance to the manufacturing process. The program offers an opportunity for students to challenge the shielded metal arc weld test, in accordance with CSA W47.1/W59 standards, at extra cost for positions of their choosing through the Canadian Welders Bureau.

b96615a4-8b3f-4e73-b065-606aba876e7a," The text provides information about the demand and growth of welding careers in Ontario between 2010 and 2025, which is expected to see around 15% growth. The industries that offer employment opportunities for welders include transportation, petrochemical, oil and gas, aerospace, fabrication, manufacturing, pipelines, mining, and construction.

The text also lists the required courses for the welding program in semesters 1 and 2, with their respective codes and names. Semester 1 includes WELD 1010 to WELD 1015, and Semester 2 includes PORT 1001, WELD 1112 to WELD 1118. The learning outcomes of the program include performing work responsibly and in compliance with Occupational Health and Safety Act, interpreting engineering drawings and blueprints, selecting and planning metal fabrication operations, and creating welds on various types of materials and joints to industrial standards and codes.",scraped_pages/programpages2024/Welding Techniques Program T166 | George Brown College2024.txt
34fd0c3d-9e63-41e5-8186-187aa0e189ba," The text provides information about a welding program offered at George Brown College. The program involves learning various types of materials and joints in major welding positions to industrial standards and codes. Students will use shop tools and equipment to manufacture, assemble, maintain and repair components according to required specifications and industry standards. They are expected to interact effectively and professionally in shop environments and assess weld quality, implementing corrective action where necessary.

Tuition and fees for the program are provided, with separate costs listed for domestic and international students for the first two semesters starting in Fall 2023 and Fall 2024, respectively. The text indicates that tuition fees are subject to board approval while material, student service, and ancillary fees are estimated based on prior years. International students should visit a specific page for more information on related costs.

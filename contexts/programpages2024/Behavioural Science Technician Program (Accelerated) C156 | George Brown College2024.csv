This program offers two intensive field placements, with students expected to spend approximately 7.5 hours per day, four days a week off-site and one day on-site at George Brown College. Placements will be conducted with clients who may have autism, mental health issues, acquired brain injury, developmental disabilities, behavioural concerns or issues related to aging. Partner agencies are located across the GTA.

Graduates of this program may find employment in various settings including ABA therapy programs, schools, hospitals, residential and treatment facilities, and vocational agencies, among others. Required courses for the Behavioural Science Technician program during semester 2 include BST 1003 - Behavioural Theory.",scraped_pages/programpages2024/Behavioural Science Technician Program (Accelerated) C156 | George Brown College2024.txt

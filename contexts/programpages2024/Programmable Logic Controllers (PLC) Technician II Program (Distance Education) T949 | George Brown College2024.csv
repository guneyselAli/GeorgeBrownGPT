1705986083389201000," This distance education certificate program offers training in PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), specifically DCS (Distributed Control Systems) and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems). The program utilizes the simulator PLCLogix 5000 and Studio 5000/Rockwell RSLogix 5000 software for comprehensive coverage of tag-based PLC programming. The simulation software includes over 250 pre-built lab projects and 10 manufacturing environments.

The program is open for enrolment at any time, with no set completion time and flexible pacing. Students will use an interactive learning package to complete modules containing text, audio, 2D and 3D animations, computer-based testing, and PLCLogix 5000 simulation software. Each module is accompanied by a final exam taken online (computer-based testing).

Prerequisites include an Ontario Secondary School Diploma or equivalent, or mature student status. Minimum computer requirements are an Intel Core i3, i5, i7, AMD Ryzen 3, 5, 7 processor or equivalent, 4GB RAM, 500MB of available disk space, Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11 operating system, and internet access with an email account.

The typical completion time for the program is 32 weeks, but there are no set time limits. If students have minimal or no background in PLCs, they are recommended to begin with the foundation PLC Technician program.",scraped_pages/programpages2024/Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) Technician II Program (Distance Education) T949 | George Brown College2024.txt

1705986083389202000," The George Brown College offers a PLC Technician II program as an online distance education. The total tuition for the program starting in Fall 2023 is $4,570 ($440 for initial registration + $70 x 18 modules). International students are charged the same fees but in U.S. dollars and the exchange rate at the time of registration will be used to determine the final fee in Canadian dollars. This program does not qualify for OSAP funding and is not eligible for study/work permit eligibility in Canada, meaning international students must study while remaining in their home country.

Applicants need an Ontario Secondary School Diploma or equivalent or mature student status to apply. Previous practical PLC experience is helpful but not essential.

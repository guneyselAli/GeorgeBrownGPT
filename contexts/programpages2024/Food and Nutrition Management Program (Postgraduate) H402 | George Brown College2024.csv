These requirements include providing proof of medical records such as TDAP shot, COVID-19, MMR, Varicella, Hep B blood test reports/titres, Two-Step TB Skin Test, an annual Vulnerable Sector Check, and an annual flu shot. Mask fit tests are required every two years. Students must submit all requirements by the program specific deadline to the ParaMed Placement Pass website.

COVID-19 vaccination is mandatory for students in order to complete clinical placements within facilities. Renewed annually, students are also required to have a Vulnerable Sector Check completed and renewed every year before entering into field or clinical placement. The process for obtaining a Vulnerable Sector Check typically takes between two to three months but can take up to eight months under some circumstances. This requirement is in place to protect the clientele of placement partner agencies, considered ""vulnerable persons"" under the law. Students are responsible for ensuring that their Vulnerable Sector Check covers appropriateness for individuals working with vulnerable persons.

All costs associated with the health requirements are the responsibility of the student. For more details and to download the mandatory Pre-placement health form, students can visit the Clinical Pre-placement website.",scraped_pages/programpages2024/Food and Nutrition Management Program (Postgraduate) H402 | George Brown College2024.txt

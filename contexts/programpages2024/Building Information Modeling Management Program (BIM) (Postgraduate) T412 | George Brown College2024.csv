1705971360354021000," The text is about a one-year graduate certificate program offered by the college for using BIM tools and implementing BIM Management processes in organizations involved in building procurement, design, construction, and operation. Students will have access to advanced BIM lab facilities and learn practical skills through work environment and online modules.

Companies that accept BIM students for field experience include architectural, engineering, general contracting firms, subcontracting companies, government building departments, project developers, construction management firms, suppliers, and building manufacturing firms. Students must complete 450 hours of field experience, but the college does not guarantee a position. It is expected that students will be compensated for their field experience, though some may be unpaid or commission-based. Previous work experience in BIM can potentially be considered toward the mandatory field experience, and graduates are required to apply to graduate schools themselves upon completion of the program. There is an opportunity for students to engage in BIM-related applied research while completing the program.

The three-semester graduate certificate program includes a field experience in semester 3 to help students transition into the job market. Career options upon graduation include various project environments and positions that may involve practicing BIM. The text does not provide any specific information regarding program coordinators, emails, or names.",scraped_pages/programpages2024/Building Information Modeling Management Program (BIM) (Postgraduate) T412 | George Brown College2024.txt

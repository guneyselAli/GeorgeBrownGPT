The program also covers several important concepts, including safety, scholarship, relational practice, determinants of health, diversity, professional nursing practice, leadership, health systems, teaching/learning.

The curriculum includes required professionally related courses in anatomy and physiology, microbiology, psychology, as well as elective courses from other disciplines. The first two years of the program are completed at George Brown's Waterfront Campus. In Year I, students focus on knowledge of self in the context of health and develop effective communication abilities and foundational nursing practice skills. In Year II, students shift their focus to knowledge of others in the context of illness.

Students are recognized as adult learners responsible for their learning, and learning is characterized as an interactive, lifelong process. The student-educator relationship is based on mutual trust and respect.

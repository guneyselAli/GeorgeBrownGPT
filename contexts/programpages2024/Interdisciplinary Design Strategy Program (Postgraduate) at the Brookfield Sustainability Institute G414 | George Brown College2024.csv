The program focuses on design research, strategy, and social innovation to create smart sustainable solutions for a better future. It aims to produce graduates who are problem solvers with the ability to affect positive change. Students come from various fields and collaborate interdisciplinary teams to tackle real-world challenges. Projects may involve travel to collaborate with communities outside of GBC, and students are responsible for additional travel expenses. The major project for the 2023-24 cohort is ""Urban Food Security"".",scraped_pages/programpages2024/Interdisciplinary Design Strategy Program (Postgraduate) at the Brookfield Sustainability Institute G414 | George Brown College2024.txt
1706012785446119000," The college is currently working on a major project for the 2023-24 academic year titled ""Urban Food Security."" The goal of this project is to create a smart sustainable urban agriculture model and pilot for Toronto to address food insecurity, which affects one in five Torontonians. The project includes increasing opportunities for stakeholders to access or grow food ingredients, creating food systems that are supportive of natural ecology and permaculture, considering policy/finance/business models for a successful and scalable design pilot, and incorporating the use of smart technology/electronic sensors/IOT devices.

Prior major projects include ""Massive Change: the Future of Global Design,"" which resulted in a book and travelling exhibition, and ""The World House Project,"" a three-year initiative that looked at housing systems that are globally responsible and locally appropriate. Students and faculty developed sustainable, intelligent, universal and affordable housing models for Canada and Costa Rica as part of this project.

Another project was titled ""City Systems,"" which aimed to explore, dissect and re-imagine the complexities of urban life. Over the course of four years, the college partnered with various organizations including the Toronto Community Housing Corporation, the municipality of Lota (Chile), the City of Markham, and Dublin City Council on community rejuvenation proposals, civic engagement programs, and change labs for community building and innovation.

A third project focused on ""Regional Ecologies,"" looking at urbanization as a regional phenomenon. The Institute examined the three gateway cities of Toronto, New York and Chicago in the first year, and began the next chapter of Regional Ecologies, titled ""Divided Places,"" in the second year. This project looked at regions characterized by sharp differences in wealth, infrastructure and density where virtual and physical segmentation creates stark social, economic and political inequalities. In the third year, the Institute explored ""Interstitial Zones,"" which are commonly defined as rural areas but include suburbs, agricultural zones, industrial hubs and small-scale craft production areas and towns.

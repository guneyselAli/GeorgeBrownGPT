1706003701586510000," Students who have completed courses at another accredited post-secondary institution or at George Brown College may be eligible for advanced standing or transfer credits to higher levels or semesters in various programs. The eligibility for transfer credits depends on the academic grades received in the previous studies and the availability of space in the program. Students must possess the required prerequisites and meet the minimum grade requirements for each specific course in the program to be granted an exemption (transfer credit). The transferred courses are not recorded as graded courses and are not used in the calculation of the student's GPA. George Brown College reserves the right to assess transfer credits on an individual basis and make changes in rules, regulations, and policies as required.

For Degree Program Transfers:
- Students must have received a C (63% or higher) for degree level or University courses or a B (70% or higher) in a Certificate or Diploma level at an accredited community college/institute of technology courses to be eligible for transfer credits to a degree level program.

For Continuing Education, Certificate & Diploma Program Transfers:
- Students who have completed studies at another accredited post-secondary institution or at George Brown College must have received the required grades. The details are not explicitly stated in the text.

Transfer credits are shown as an EX (Exemption) on a student's record, and internal transfer credits are applied from the original program to the new program and calculated in the GPA. For more information regarding course and block transfer credits, visit the Transfer Guide on George Brown College's website.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Frequently Asked Questions About Transfer Guide and Exemptions | George Brown College.txt
1706003701586513000," The text provides information about transfer credits, exemptions, GPA calculation, advanced standing, block transfer, and articulation agreements at George Brown College. Here's the extracted information:

1. Transfer credit or exemption: A transfer credit from another institution is recorded as an exemption (EX) on the student record and not included in the GPA calculation.
2. Grading system: The grade points are the product of the value of the letter grade and the course credit. The GPA is the sum of the course grade points for all courses divided by the sum of the course credits.
3. Advanced standing: It is a process that enables entry to a semester higher than semester one at George Brown College. Students applying for advanced standing are granted block credits for previous courses taken in a related area of study, which allows them to enter the second semester or higher of a program. The advanced standing grade (AS) is assigned to all courses for the semester for which a block transfer is granted and is not calculated in the student's GPA.
4. Articulation agreements: These are formal agreements between institutions that allow transfer of credits from a specific program at one institution to be applied towards advanced standing or entry at another institution. Students can use these agreements to move between different programs, institutions, and credentials. George Brown College has signed articulation agreements with various institutions, which can be found in the Transfer Agreements and Opportunities Database.
5. Block transfer opportunities: These are pathways that allow students to transfer blocks of credits without a formal articulation agreement. An example at George Brown is that a graduate from any Architectural Technology program in Ontario can be granted advanced standing.
6. Contact information: To learn more about applying for advanced standing, contact the Admissions Office at 416 415-5000 ext. 4805.

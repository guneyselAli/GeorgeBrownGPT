1705971359643670000," Canada requires nearly six million new homes by 2030 to make housing more affordable and accommodate the next generation. Building these homes using traditional approaches could add 20% more emissions to Canada's third-largest footprint. The text highlights the need for a new ""greenprint"" to change building design, construction, renovation, and heating methods. Progress is being made with sustainable building approaches and financial mechanisms.

First, powering homes must be addressed. Canada relies on natural gas but heat pumps are a low-emissions alternative that is not yet cost effective for Canadians. Regulations coming this summer will change this. However, electrifying buildings in the wrong way could lead to dramatic electricity rate increases for struggling Canadians. Every province must find ways to generate and transmit more electricity at lower costs and with fewer emissions.

Second, materials used to build buildings, such as cement, steel, account for 30% of a building's overall carbon footprint and can add nearly two decades of emissions. Canada is among the world leaders in green steel and other sustainable construction materials. A new wave of mass timber is mentioned as an option.

* Carbicrete in Montreal is turning concrete into a carbon sink.
* Mattamy Homes' Springwater community in Markham, Ont., is net zero ready and features geo-exchange technology that reduces emissions by 75%.
* Changes to zoning and codes could lead to the development of new communities with smaller, more affordable starter homes closer to mass transit.
* The EU has a harmonizing building reporting tool across Europe, and Paris is ensuring all new public buildings will be built with at least 50% timber or sustainable materials by 2024.
* The federal government is leading the way with green procurement standards for embodied emissions of buildings.
* Toronto's Taking Action on Tower Renewal initiative dedicates millions to retrofits that reduce emissions and improve affordability while protecting tenants.
* Quadreal, an arm of the BC Investment Management Corp., is using data to take ownership of the challenge.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Canada needs a greenprint for the next housing boom | George Brown College.txt
1705971359643670000," The text discusses the need for transitioning buildings towards net zero emissions in Canada and the challenges in achieving this goal. Quadreal, an arm of the BC Investment Management Corp., is using data from carbon audits to inform property level transition plans and sharing that data with industry partners to drive the industry towards net zero. The text mentions that previous tax breaks for energy retrofits have had low demand. The RBC Climate Action Institute and the Brookfield Sustainability Institute collaborated on a research report called ""High Rise, Low Carbon,"" which estimated that it will cost Canada tens of billions of dollars each year to make this transition. They launched a climate-smart buildings coalition with EllisDon and Mattamy Homes to put ideas into action. The text also mentions John Stackhouse, senior vice-president in the Office of the CEO at Royal Bank of Canada, and Gervan Fearon, president of George Brown College.

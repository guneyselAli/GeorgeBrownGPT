1705971359071248000," The text discusses the considerations for evaluating environmentally preferable products or services. The following environmental attributes are desirable:

1. Biodegradable: Substances that decompose into harmless raw materials in a relatively short time (months or years) and do not cause harm to the ecosystem when biodegraded.
2. CFC-free: Products not containing Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are compounds that destroy the planet's stratospheric ozone protection layer.
3. Compostable: Solid products that can be placed in a compost of decaying biodegradable materials and eventually turn into a nutrient-rich material.
4. Durable: Products with good lifespan and performance.
5. Energy-efficient: Products that use less energy than most similar products or are at least 10% more efficient than the minimum level meeting Canadian federal government standards.
6. Heavy metal free: Products without lead, mercury, cadmium or other heavy metals.
7. Low volatile organic compound (VOC) content, low-toxicity: Products with a minimal amount of chemicals that readily evaporate and contribute to air pollution, many of which are toxic and carcinogenic.
8. Renewable materials: Materials made from plant-based feedstock capable of regenerating in less than 200 years.
9. Persistent, bio-accumulative toxin (PBT)-free: Products without substances that persist in the environment and accumulate in organisms.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Socially Responsible Procurement | George Brown College.txt
1705971359071249000," The text discusses various sustainability practices used by the college or products offered by it. Here is the extracted information:

1. PBT-free: The college or its products are Persistent, bio-accumulative toxin (PBT)-free. PBTs are toxic chemicals that persist in the environment and increase in concentration through food chains. They include heavy metals and chemicals such as mercury, dioxins, and PCBs.

2. Recycled post-consumer content: The college or its products have a percentage of recycled materials in them.

3. Reduced greenhouse gas emissions: The college or its products help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The major greenhouse gases are water vapor and carbon dioxide, with other greenhouse gases including methane, ozone (O3), CFCs, and nitrogen oxides.

4. Refurbished product: The college offers refurbished products, which are completely disassembled and restored to their original working order while maximizing the reuse of its original materials.

5. Upgradeable: Some of the college's products have the ability to increase performance or features without replacing the product.

6. Water-efficient: The college offers water-efficient products, which are in the upper 25 percent of water efficiency for all similar products.

7. Contact Information: George Brown College can be reached at 416-415-2000 or TTY: 1-877-515-5559. The email address is ask.george@georgebrown.ca. The college has a social media hub for visitors to explore.

8. Land Acknowledgment and Sign Up: The text includes a call to action to learn more about the college's land acknowledgment and sign up for updates, deadlines, events, tours, and more.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Socially Responsible Procurement | George Brown College.txt

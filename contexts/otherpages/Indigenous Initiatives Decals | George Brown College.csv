07e9e47f-2e5d-439d-8c38-21d478b2c64e," The Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation and George Brown College have formed a new partnership through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The initiatives under this MOU include: displaying the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation crest on campus doors, creating and displaying full Land Acknowledgement decals, and collaborating on innovative access programming, co-creating curriculum, and bringing Indigenous guest speakers into the classroom.

The Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation is part of the Ojibwe (Anishinaabe) Nation, one of North America's largest Aboriginal nations. The college has three campuses that sit on treaty Mississauga land. By signing an MOU, important changes are being brought to the college campuses.

The Indigenous land acknowledgment is a statement made at the beginning of George Brown College events to recognize the traditional territory upon which they are situated. For more information about the land acknowledgement and to stay updated on application deadlines, college news, upcoming events, tours, and more, you can sign up on their website or contact ask.george@georgebrown.ca. The phone number for inquiries is 416-415-2000 with a TTY number of 1-877-515-5559. Their social media hub can also be visited for more information.

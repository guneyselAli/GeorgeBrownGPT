It aims to raise funds to create at least 40 scholarships for students demonstrating dedication to their field of study, community involvement, and financial need, with each scholarship valued between $500-$1,000. Donors can direct their support to helping students in healthcare, construction, and other frontline areas. The Foundation has supported the diverse student population to keep education accessible since 1984, raising money for scholarships, bursaries, and transformational initiatives that strengthen the College's ability to offer programs for specific industries and professions.

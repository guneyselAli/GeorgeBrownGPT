8fd7dc35-bf36-4139-84b4-b124d760adac," The George Brown College has a Green Team that provides information on the recycling and trash process at the college. When you dispose of waste, you are expected to separate it at the source by placing items in the correct container - one for recyclables (paper products and glass/plastics/aluminium) and another for non-recyclable waste. Each container has three sections and three separate bags: transparent ones for recyclables and a black bag for non-recyclable waste. The custodial staff collects the materials from the containers throughout each day, but all three bags are placed in an extra-large bag for transport.

Non-recyclable waste is taken to a landfill in Thorold, Ontario, while recyclables go into dedicated rollaway containers that are picked up by a different waste management company. At the recycling plant, paper products are baled and shipped out to mills for reuse, while metal and plastic material is broken down, shredded or melted for reuse or complete destruction.

Key information:
- The college has recycling and trash containers with three sections and three separate bags.
- Paper products, glass, plastics and aluminium go into the first two recyclable sections, while non-recyclable waste goes into the third section.
- The custodial staff collects materials from the containers daily and places them in an extra-large bag for transport.
- Non-recyclable waste is taken to a landfill in Thorold, Ontario.
- Recyclables are taken to a recycling plant where they are processed (paper products are baled and shipped out, metal and plastic material is broken down or melted).",scraped_pages/otherpages/The Story of Recycling | George Brown College.txt

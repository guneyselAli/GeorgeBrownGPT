d117ff83-f4fb-4f12-8a75-1650d89d56e9," The George Brown College had three graduates, Doan (Lucas) Dang, Nick Lourenco, and Mike Lino, who won the top prize at the Chartered Institute of Building's Global Student Challenge in 2018. They were mentored by professor Andrew Gordon from the Angelo Del Zotto School of Construction Management. The competition involved using MERIT simulation software for running a virtual construction company and bidding on projects against competitors, which is part of the Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) program's curriculum. The trio was the only college team and the only group from North America to make it to the final six. They accepted their award at a ceremony in Toronto on July 12, 2018. For more information about the win, refer to the Daily Commerical News.

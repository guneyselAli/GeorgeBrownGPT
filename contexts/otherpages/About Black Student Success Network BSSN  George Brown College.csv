b70d404a-edcb-4881-b8e9-b67fe7f53d12," The Black Student Success Network (BSSN) is a student-driven initiative at George Brown College, established in response to research showing a significant number of Black students were leaving their programs early in the School of Social and Community Services. The network started as a pilot project in the 2016-17 academic year, supporting only students in Social and Community Services programs. Following student feedback, BSSN expanded its support to other programs and campuses across the college in Fall 2017. The goal is to develop best practices and guidelines for supporting, engaging, and retaining a growing number of ""diverse"" students. The contact email for feedback is bssn@georgebrown.ca. Students can sign up for updates on application deadlines, college news, upcoming events, tours, and more via the website. The phone numbers are 416-415-2000 and TTY: 1-877-515-5559. The email for general inquiries is ask.george@georgebrown.ca.

The college is required to adhere to accessibility standards and principles when designing, adopting, and procuring educational materials and resources. This includes textbooks, e-books, course packs, e-learning platforms, audio-visual and multimedia.

The College's AODA Accessibility Policy (revised 2017) and the Captioned Media and e-Text Policy (2006) stipulate that all materials produced or purchased for instructional purposes must be accessible, and that textbooks and course materials used for instructional purposes must be available in an accessible format. The Bookstore will only acquire textbooks and course packs that are available in an accessible format.

Xerox was appointed as the single source course pack producer and manager for George Brown College in March 2018. Each academic division is responsible for ensuring compliance with these policies, and faculty members are also involved. The college provides support to employees throughout these processes. Employees can contact key point persons for accessibility of classroom resources at 416-415-2000 or TTY: 1-877-515-5559, or email ask.george@georgebrown.ca.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Teaching and Learning: Resources & Supports | George Brown College.txt

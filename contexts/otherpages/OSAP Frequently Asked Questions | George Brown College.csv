1705971359234481000," OSAP ( Ontario Student Assistance Program) provides funding for students in the form of grants and loans, which are deposited separately. Full-time students have their funding released at the beginning of their study period, but it may take up to 10 business days for processing. Students can decline loan funding by selecting the ""No Loan Option"" on their OSAP application funding summary.

OSAP funding may not be available for all students. Reasons for ineligibility include lack of registration as full-time students or failure to provide correct Student Number on application form. Students can obtain a new password by visiting the financial assistance office with government-issued photo ID and SIN card. Proof of SIN can also be provided in other ways.

OSAP assesses applications based on income information, which may require parental/spousal information for students. Once CRA ( Canada Revenue Agency) verifies the income tax returns, OSAP funding will be reassessed. Students who do not file a tax return with CRA or have foreign income may need to provide additional documentation to prove their income.

The six-month grace period begins after graduation, completion of studies, or ceasing to be a full-time student. Repayment of loans starts at the end of this period. Students with low family income can apply for reduced monthly loan payments.",scraped_pages/otherpages/OSAP Frequently Asked Questions | George Brown College.txt

These policies apply to all members of the college, including employees, students, volunteers, and third parties.

The Emergency Evacuation Planning and Procedures policy outlines procedures for implementing individual emergency response plans for employees with disabilities, as well as templates for creating such plans. Employees should submit requests for an Individualized Emergency Response Plan to their supervisor and direct questions to the college's Manager, Safety & Wellness.

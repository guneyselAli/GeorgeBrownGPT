1705984428932897000," If you received OSAP ( Ontarian Student Assistance Program) during your study period, you are required to repay your loans after graduation or leaving full-time studies. The six-month grace period begins after finishing your studies. During this period, interest is charged on the provincial portion of your loan. From April 1, 2021, to March 31, 2023, no interest will be charged on the federal portion of an OSAP loan.

Repayment is based on a 9.5-year pay-back schedule. After six months, you can manage your loan, make payments, and apply for repayment assistance through your National Student Loans Service Centre (NSLSC) account. You may qualify for a six-month repayment assistance period during which your monthly loan payments will be lowered. If you choose to extend your repayment period, it can be increased from 9.5 years up to 14.5 years through the NSLSC account.

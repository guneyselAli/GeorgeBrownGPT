1705971359817281000," Starting from March 1, 2021, students at George Brown College can change their preferred first name through a self-service process on Stu-view. The preferred name will be reflected in Stu-view, Brightspace, Email, and Microsoft Office applications. However, this process will not alter the legal name required for business practices and legal requirements such as transcripts, confirmation of enrolment, financial records, and credentials.

Students need to log into their Stu-view account, select the 'Personal Information' tab, and select 'Preferred First Name'. Once the information is entered, it will be directed to the Office of the Registrar and updated on the student record within 2-3 business days. An email confirmation will be sent to the George Brown College email address.

The preferred name will appear in systems like Stu-view, Brightspace, Email, and Microsoft Office applications but may not reflect in all interconnected systems due to ongoing improvements. Some departments may need to send information to the federal or provincial government where a legal name is necessary, so students and departments must be aware that some systems may not reflect a student's preferred name.

Documents issued by the College such as transcripts, confirmation of enrolment, financial records, and credentials will not reflect a student's preferred first name. Some college systems are not yet integrated with the preferred first name information and will use the legal name instead.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Preferred First Name | George Brown College.txt
1705971359817281000," Students can change their preferred first name through Stu-view without requiring supporting documentation. The College reserves the right to remove inappropriate or offensive names and names used for misrepresentation. A legal name change requires proof of documentation and will be reflected on all student records, including transcripts, credentials, confirmation of enrolments, and financial records. Students must provide legal name change documents to the College for official name changes, which include a Marriage Certificate, Legal Name Change document, Birth Certificate, or Driver's License. Changes to pronouns are under investigation for later phases of system implementation. At this time, preferred first name changes automatically appear on student records if applied on or after March 1, 2021. Students can revert their first name to their legal name by contacting Registration and then using the Stu-view option. Students can request to have their gender updated but it is not currently displayed on any front-facing systems. For additional resources related to human rights, discrimination, and harassment, students can contact the Office of Anti-Racism, Equity & Human Rights Services at diversity@georgebrown.ca.

1. George Brown College has a Records Management Policy Framework that outlines the College’s perspective on records, including the principle of disposing of personal information accountably and as legislation requires.
2. The College must adhere to Ontario’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA), which identifies the College's responsibilities in its collection, use, and destruction of personal information.
3. Regulation 459 of FIPPA states that an educational institution may dispose of personal information only in specific ways: by transfer to another institution or organization with authority to hold it; by disposing it in a manner prescribed by the College's records retention schedule; or by destroying it in a secure and confidential manner.
4. The College has its own Archives which care for all records that are retained permanently or long-term. All records types that are identified as ""Personal Information Bank"" records in Ontario's FIPPA Directory of Records must be destroyed through the College Archives.
5. Destruction of personal information requires authorization from the head of the institution, and operational responsibility for records rests locally with each department head. Reasonable steps must be taken to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information during its storage, transportation, handling, and destruction.
6. FIPPA specifies the criteria for adequate destruction of information: it must be destroyed in a way that it cannot be reconstructed or retrieved.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Disposal of Information Policy | George Brown College.txt

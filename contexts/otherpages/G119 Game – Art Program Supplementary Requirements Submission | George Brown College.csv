If applicants receive communication from the college stating that they are being considered for the divisional select process, they are required to complete an Application Questionnaire and submit a portfolio of their work. The Application Questionnaire is designed to describe future career objectives and intentions in the Game – Art program and should be completed solely by the applicant in English. A link to a web-site, Google Drive or Dropbox folder containing samples from the personal portfolio should also be included in the form.

The portfolio should include at least 10 pieces of the applicant's best work, and may include samples of life drawing, sketches, paintings, sculpture, photography, digital art, games, and level designs with instructions on how to install them. The confidential results will be submitted by the School of Design to the Admissions Office upon review of the Application Questionnaire and Portfolio. The Admissions Office will then make a decision on the application, and applicants will receive notification via email and mail if they are successful. Applicants should allow at least a week for the review and submission of their results to the Admissions Office.

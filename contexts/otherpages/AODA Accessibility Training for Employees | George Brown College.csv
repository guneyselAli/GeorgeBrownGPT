1705971359772216000," The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) is a law that requires completion of accessibility training for all employees, volunteers, contractors, and others who provide goods, services or facilities on behalf of George Brown College. The training modules are available on Cornerstone (My Learning).

Employees involved in course design, delivery and instruction are required to complete the Accessibility Awareness Training for Educators module. Additional modules may apply to specific employee groups.

The training modules were updated as of June 2018. Employees who have previously completed mandatory AODA training will remain credited. New employees and any other employees who have not previously completed the training are required to complete the new modules. Staff wishing to complete refresher training may also access these modules.

Students or members of the public who would like to complete this training can access the modules online on AccessForward and on the Ontario Human Rights Commission website.

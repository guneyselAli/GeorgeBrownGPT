b14496d7-c5f9-42a0-aadc-5e70bc4389a2," The text describes a tool that assesses the readiness of units (departments or divisions) in engaging with racial equity work. The assessment is a checklist of features that help determine the focus of units on racial equity, and it provides a starting point for advancing anti-racism efforts. Anyone can use this tool individually or in groups to discuss progress towards equity, diversity, and inclusion. The sections of the assessment include A, B, C, and D. Users are asked to check all boxes that apply to their unit and total the number of checked boxes in each section. The text also mentions two places on the continuum: one that is ""colour-blind"" and does not prioritize equity and inclusion, and another where organizations focus on diversity but may not be actively attuned to equity and inclusion.

ccc5f540-1d39-4f5f-9837-edd15e67f0b7," The Tutoring and Learning Centre (TLC) of George Brown College offers in-person and online tutoring. Students can log in using their GBC credentials and book sessions. The resources on the TLC site are designed as study aids for English and math, but they do not cover all aspects of these subjects. Resources include materials on essay writing, citation styles, grammar, and more. Preparation materials, useful websites, and practice handouts are also available. Students can contact the TLC Advisor for English or the TLC Math Advisor if they cannot find what they're looking for. The contact information for the advisors is 416-415-2000 (regular line) and 1-877-515-5559 (TTY). Students can also send emails to ask.george@georgebrown.ca. The TLC Advisors welcome feedback, which should be filled out using a feedback form with the type of resource, name of the resource, and error description. The website's content is subject to change without notice, and students are responsible for verifying George Brown College fee requirements. The TLC provides resources related to essay writing, citation styles, grammar, and other subjects. They offer a Social Media Hub for more information, and application deadlines, college news, upcoming events, tours, and more can be accessed by signing up.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Tutoring and Learning Centre Resources | George Brown College.txt

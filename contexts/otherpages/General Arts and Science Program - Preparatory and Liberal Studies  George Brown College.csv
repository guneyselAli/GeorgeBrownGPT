4921ce8f-8377-43d5-bd72-be767edd9f06," The General Arts and Science (GAS) program at George Brown College offers a one-year certificate and a two-year diploma. The one-year certificate program helps students develop critical thinking, communication skills, and academic/communication skills, making it ideal for those seeking clarity about future educational pathways at college or university. Students who complete the certificate program can proceed directly into the second year of the General Arts & Science diploma program.

The two-year diploma program is suitable for students looking to continue onto a higher-level post-secondary institute, providing them with at least a yearâ€™s worth of transfer credits. The first year of the course is identical to the one-year certificate program, while the second year offers opportunities to explore liberal studies in a post-secondary program and develop university-level academic skills.

Graduates of the General Arts & Science diploma program may be eligible for advanced standing transfer credits at various post-secondary institutions, including the University of Waterloo and the University of Toronto. Specifically, graduates with a GPA of 3.0 or higher from the R101 diploma program may be eligible for admission to the Honours Bachelor of Arts program at the University of Waterloo with up to 9.5 transfer credits, equivalent to almost half of a four-year degree. Similarly, graduates with a GPA of 3.0 or higher from George Brown College may be eligible for admission to the Faculty of Arts and Science at the University of Toronto with 6.0 transfer credits. In addition, eligible students have the opportunity to enroll in spring/summer courses at U of T after completing Semester 2 and earn additional course credits towards their degree.

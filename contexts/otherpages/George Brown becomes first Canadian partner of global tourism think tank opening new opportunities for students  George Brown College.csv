3e6c8a95-f6db-40a1-a498-5f406b117c36," George Brown College has entered into a partnership with the Global Tourism Resilience & Crisis Management Centre (GTRCMC) based at the University of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica. The partnership will see George Brown establish a satellite centre in Toronto for research and development, policy advocacy, program/project design and management, and training and capacity building in various areas related to tourism resilience. The partnership includes international learning exchange, joint teaching between the institutions, industry-focused student exchange, and applied research activities. This collaboration is particularly beneficial for George Brown's School of Hospitality & Tourism Management and the Brookfield Sustainability Institute, which focuses on providing innovative solutions to problems caused by climate change. The partnership was formalized with a memorandum of understanding signed on March 25, 2022, by George Brown President Dr. Gervan Fearon and Jamaican Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett. The GTRCMC was established in 2008 by Bartlett and former Secretary-General of the United Nations World Tourism Organization Dr. Taleb Rafai to help global tourism centres prepare for and recover from industry disruptors such as pandemics and climate change.

83d3573d-9b85-42a0-820a-e4413b0467ba," Ontario legislation requires individuals entering healthcare, dental, or field work practice settings to meet certain surveillance requirements. This policy adheres to Communicable Disease Surveillance protocols from the Ontario Public Health, Ontario Hospital Association, Ontario Medical Association, Long Term Care Association, and Ontario School Boards.

The Placement Pass Program by ParaMed is approved by George Brown College for managing this clearance process. ParaMed and George Brown College have partnered since 2008. Students in Community Services, Health Sciences, and Hospitality programs must meet the surveillance requirements to participate in clinical or field work practice per semester and academic year.

Students can register for the program on the George Brown College Stu-View website starting November 13, 2023. Once registered, students will be able to create an account and submit required Health Form documents within 24 hours. ParaMed provides health care and support services since 1974 and has achieved accreditation with exemplary status through Accreditation Canada.

50d8da82-b2f6-40b8-b910-486117d2b558," Camara is a Marketing Design and Project Coordinator for David C. Cook Distribution Canada, working in graphic design for sales and marketing presentations for new books or an entire line of books. She graduated from George Brown College with a focus on graphic design, which allows students to discover their specialization throughout the program. The program's strong industry connections and professional certification from the Registered Graphic Designers of Ontario (RGD) were important considerations for Camara. She won an award in the RGD Student Awards competition during her final year. In her current role, she communicates with printers and suppliers to print thousands of publications, having gone from printing one project for grading to much larger responsibilities. Camara took co-op in grade 11 but decided against teaching visual arts and considered graphic design due to instructor recommendations. She found George Brown's program unique because it allows students to specialize in an area of design rather than a generic focus.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Alumni Stories - School of Design | George Brown College.txt

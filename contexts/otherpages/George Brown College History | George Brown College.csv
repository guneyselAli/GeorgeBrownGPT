1705976777975846000," George Brown (1818-1880) was a 19th-century Scottish-born Canadian politician and newspaper publisher. He is known for founding The Globe, precursor to The Globe and Mail, and being one of the Fathers of Confederation. In Canada's centennial year, 1967, Bill Davis, then Ontario Minister of Education, suggested naming a new college of applied arts and technology after George Brown.

George Brown College opened in 1968 with just over 2,000 students, offering programs in construction, early childhood education, dental services, culinary arts, signwriting, watchmaking, marine engineering, and more. Since then, the full-time student population has grown to around 30,000.

The college's history can be traced back to the early 1950s with the formation of two provincial organizations: The Department of Education and the Provincial Institute of Trades. In 1964, the Department of Education created the Provincial Institute of Trades and transferred all apprenticeship training from the Ryerson Institute of Technology to it.

The Provincial Institute of Trades opened at 21 Nassau St., in Kensington Market, with Charles Emery as its first principal. Due to a need for more space, two additional buildings were constructed in Kensington Market where students contributed to the construction through field placements. The Provincial Institute of Trades started broadening its program selection by including courses in lathing, structural steel, barbering, diesel mechanics, jewellery arts, watchmaking, and welding. The Provincial Institute of Trades also launched the Provincial Institute of Trades and Occupations to meet the growing demand for vocational training.

Since 2004, George Brown has more than doubled in size and broadened international partnerships while increasing its commitment to strengthening Toronto's cultural, economic, and social fabric.

1705976777975848000," The Institute of Trades launched the Provincial Institute of Trades and Occupations to meet the growing demand for vocational training in the late 1960s. In 1967, Minister of Education Bill Davis established Ontario’s public college system, and George Brown College of Applied Arts and Technology was founded through the amalgamation of the Provincial Institute of Trades and the Provincial Institute of Trades and Occupations. C.C. Lloyd was named the first principal.

George Brown College began operations on March 1, 1967, with 2,009 students and 187 instructors spread across five buildings on two campuses: the Dartnell Campus, near Casa Loma, and the Nassau Street Campus in Kensington Market. Overcrowding was an immediate concern, with some programs forced to run in three shifts from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. The College Street Campus (507 College St.) opened in the late 1960s and George Brown integrated 4,000 students and staff from four Adult Training Centres (ATC). Initially, it offered academic upgrading, commercial courses, the rapidly expanding ESL program, and other vocational training programs such as nursery aid, dressmaking and alterations, pattern making and design, commercial art, signwriting, offset printing, furniture refinishing and repair, retail merchandising, and a large truck driver training program.

In the early 1970s, George Brown added a sprawling new building at 160 Kendal Ave., which was renamed Casa Loma Campus. It offered programs in construction, computer systems and networks, jewellery making, and dance. The campus was originally intended to provide programs with a technology and applied arts focus.

Five hospital nursing schools were merged under the George Brown College umbrella: Toronto General Hospital, St. Michael’s Hospital, St. Joseph’s Hospital, the Atkinson School of Nursing (at Toronto Western Hospital), and Nightingale School of Nursing.

The St. James Campus opened at 200 King St. E. in the late 1960s and integrated George Brown into the fabric of Toronto’s downtown core. It offered programs in business, community services, deaf and deafblind studies, and work/college preparation. The main building was formerly the home of the Christie, Brown and Company Biscuit Factory and later a Hallmark Cards factory.

Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau visited the Nassau Street Campus in Kensington Market in the late 1960s and greeted students and staff with much media fanfare. The George Brown College Foundation, a separately incorporated registered charity guided by a volunteer board of directors, was established by noted restaurateur John Arena.

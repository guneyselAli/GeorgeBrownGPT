c1605c95-d7b4-49c3-9bbf-dccd49842a9c," The admission assessment is taken by Mature Applicants who are 19 years of age or older on the start date of a program and do not have the required academic credit(s), such as Grade 12 English. The assessment covers skills in English, math and/or science, and may include other program-specific tests. Depending on the results, students are placed into foundation-level courses for further skill development or college-level English and/or math courses. Students who do not complete the assessment by the deadline are automatically placed into foundation-level courses.

The placement assessment is taken by students already admitted to George Brown programs. The assessment results determine which level of English and/or math courses the student should be placed into, with students taking foundation-level courses potentially charged additional course fees. Students who do not require foundation-level support are placed into college-level English and/or math courses. Students requiring accommodations for their placement test should register with Accessible Learning Services before booking the assessment.

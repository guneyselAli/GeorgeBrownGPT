84b94a4f-b270-40ef-b2bf-c7f89c140dd4," George Brown College fashion students, led by faculty member Milan Shahani, conducted a research project to adapt second-hand clothing for people with mobility limitations. The project addressed accessibility, affordability, and sustainability issues. The students partnered with The Pegasus Community Project in Toronto, which runs programs and events for adults with developmental disabilities, and operates a second-hand store called The Pegasus Shoppe. The students upcycled clothing from the thrift store and made it adaptive and affordable for persons with disabilities. They conducted focus groups to understand the challenges faced by people with limited mobility, and created 75 adaptive garments priced at $25 or less. The garments will be available at The Pegasus Shoppe starting May 24. Students involved in the project were Shirin Fadavi, Erin James, Christina Powell, and Janelle Sookhai. Christina Powell noted that working on this project gave her new perspectives regarding garment construction and design, and that people with limited mobility felt pride when they could put on and take off the created garments. Erin James worked with a woman in the focus group to understand her needs for comfort and confidence in a shirt.","scraped_pages/otherpages/Fashion students create sustainable, affordable and adaptive garments for people with mobility challenges; sales fund non-profit organization  | George Brown College.txt"

The project was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Partnership Development Grants, with George Brown College being the only college to receive the grant for a sustainable adaptive clothing pilot project. In 2019/20, Shahani led a social innovation research project at George Brown College involving 12 women stroke survivors, where fashion students collaborated with occupational therapy students from the University of Toronto to design adaptive bras, blouses, and jackets.

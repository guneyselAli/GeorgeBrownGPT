654840bb-4fed-4011-b3fc-13a0b9a7d2e0," The ""Say My Name"" campaign is an awareness campaign launched by the Office of Anti-Racism, Equity and Human Rights at George Brown College. It was initiated by Raymund Hip Loy Lee, a student in George Brownâ€™s Honours Bachelor of Early Childhood Education program, to create a safe platform for individuals within the college community to express their preferred name and be represented correctly within the GBC community. The campaign aims to represent, learn, and celebrate the names of members of the college, particularly those with shortened or changed names or names that are often pronounced incorrectly. Raymund shared in an interview that his own experience sparked the idea for this campaign, as his name is often mispronounced due to a typo on his birth certificate and his mother's thick accent. The campaign provides resources for learning how to pronounce names correctly, or for those who may be unsure or afraid to get it wrong. There is also a focus on Indigenous Traditional Teachings related to names, and resources are available for checking the pronunciation of names through various sources.

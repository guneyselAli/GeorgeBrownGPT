The Application Questionnaire is designed to describe your future career objectives and intentions in the Graphic Design program and should be completed solely by the applicant in English. A link to a web-site, UNLOCKED Google Drive or Dropbox folder containing samples from your personal portfolio must also be included in the application.

A portfolio should include a maximum of 15 diverse pieces of your best creative work from the following three categories: Digital Work, Typography, and Traditional Art. One piece from these two categories must include all preliminary work presented on an accompanying page. Confidential results will be submitted by the School of Design to the Admissions Office upon review of your Application Questionnaire and Portfolio. The Admissions Office will make a decision on your application and you will receive notification via email and mail if you are successful. If you do receive an offer of admission, it should be accepted on www.ontariocolleges.ca as soon as possible to reserve your seat in the program.

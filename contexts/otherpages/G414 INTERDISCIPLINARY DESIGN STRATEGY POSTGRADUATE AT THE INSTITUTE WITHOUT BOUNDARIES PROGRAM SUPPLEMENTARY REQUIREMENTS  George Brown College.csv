Applicants who receive communication from the college stating that they are being considered for the next stage of the admission process are required to submit an application questionnaire, resume, and portfolio. The Application Questionnaire is designed to describe future career objectives and intentions in the program and should be completed solely by the applicant in English. Applicants should also attach a resume and provide a link to their personal portfolio. The portfolio should include 10 or more pieces of the applicant's best work from any field of study or employment. Upon review of the Application Questionnaire, Resume, and Portfolio, applicants may be invited for an interview, which may be conducted via Skype for those living more than 200 km from Toronto.

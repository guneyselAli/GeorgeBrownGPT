ab178d3f-74ca-420e-a22d-453cf0c25668," George Brown College was the first college, nursing school, and simulation centre in Canada to be accredited by the Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH) in the area of Teaching/Education. The Centre for Health Sciences at George Brown College offers an education that closely mirrors real-world settings with a commitment to preparing students for jobs after graduation.

The Simulation Centre provides over 23,000 square feet of high-tech simulation space and includes six 12-bed Simulation Practice Labs, four high-fidelity suites, one Operating Room, The Health eHome (a fully functioning bachelor apartment), three demonstration kitchens, and various high and low fidelity mannequins.

George Brown is a leader in simulation education, with highly qualified Simulationists and Technologists committed to student success. Simulation programming provides opportunities for students to work through healthcare scenarios in various settings and learn interprofessional practice principles. The Simulated Participant Program involves actors taking part in elaborate role plays to mimic clinical interactions. Virtual gaming simulations are also available to promote learning, enhancing critical thinking, clinical decision-making, communication, and team building skills.

The simulation education programming provides students with the opportunity to learn safely, practice on mannequins that communicate verbally and respond physiologically, and engage in interprofessional approaches to teaching and learning. The goal is to equip graduates with the necessary skills valued by employers upon entering hospital rooms, clinical, or homecare settings.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Simulation Centre - Health Sciences | George Brown College.txt

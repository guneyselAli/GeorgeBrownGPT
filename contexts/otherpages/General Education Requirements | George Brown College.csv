1706005448609550000," At George Brown College, students in diploma programs are required to take a total of four General Education courses. These courses are categorized into three groups: Arts and Humanities (GHUM or ISHU), Social Science (GSSC or ISSS), and Science and Technology (GSCI or ISSC). Students must take General Education courses from at least two different categories to graduate. This policy is known as the General Education breadth requirement. Students are responsible for ensuring that their elective General Education courses meet this requirement.

In most diploma programs, there are one or two mandated General Education courses that all students must take, and the remaining courses are electives. If a program's mandated General Education courses are from the same category, students must choose at least one elective from a different category to fulfill the breadth requirement.

Students in certificate programs are also required to take General Education courses but are not subject to the breadth requirement.

Some General Education electives may have content similar to program requirements, and it is the student's responsibility to ensure they do not register for General Education electives that duplicate program content. Program-mandated General Education courses cannot be used to fulfill elective requirements.

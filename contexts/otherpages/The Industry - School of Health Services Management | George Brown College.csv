1705971359154377000," Our industry partners play a key role in preparing students for real world work in the health services sector. They host field placement students and advise on program content based on latest trends. Partners range from small community organizations to large downtown Toronto hospitals and healthcare facilities.

Advances in technology are transforming healthcare, with data playing an important role. Information systems collect, store, and analyze health care data for effective and efficient treatments, research projects, and new methods of diagnosing and treating diseases. Tools facilitate telemedicine, online registration, family healthcare teams, and insights into mental health, cultural diversity, etc.

Security and confidentiality of electronic health data is a foundational aspect. Students study government legislation like PIPEDA and FIPPA.

Students are equipped with business skills for inter-professional health care teams, learning industry-specific computer programs at the Daphne Cockwell Centre for Health Sciences. Important soft skills taught include empathy, inclusiveness, compassion, and some may work with public at WAVE Clinic or have a field placement experience.

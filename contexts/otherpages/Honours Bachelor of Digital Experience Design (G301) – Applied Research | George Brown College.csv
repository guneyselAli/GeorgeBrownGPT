1705971358424950000," The Centre for Arts, Design & Information Technology at George Brown College has an Innovation Exchange and a Design Centre for the Smart Economy in their future School of Design building. This research hub will allow students and businesses to team up and bring new ideas to market with support from 5-year, multi-million dollar grants from NSERC Innovation Enhancement and Canada Foundation for Innovation programs. The funding enables Canadian companies to work with faculty and students on solving industry challenges through applied research, and adopting new approaches to designing and developing customer experiences, digital service design ecosystems, computing platforms, and alternative user interfaces. Honours Bachelor of Digital Experience Design students will play an integral role in pushing this research agenda. The School of Design has a strong track record of applied research projects, including a three-year SSHRC grant for an interactive app project with the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Students involved in research projects develop skills in various areas such as service and product development, laboratory experimentation, field research, project management, communications, ethics, entrepreneurship, leadership, and teamwork.

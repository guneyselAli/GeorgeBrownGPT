Parents using the college's child care centers can find contact information at georgebrown.ca/child-care-centres/#locations. The college does not make operational decisions lightly and balances student learning with potential weather risks. Students should check their emails, STU-VIEW, or Brightspace for updates on individual class cancellations. Students on work placements should follow the employer's policy regarding severe weather. In case of a college closure, the George Brown community will be informed through several methods. The college provides a hotline at 416-415-2000 and TTY: 1-877-515-5559, as well as an email address ask.george@georgebrown.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Winter weather guide | George Brown College.txt

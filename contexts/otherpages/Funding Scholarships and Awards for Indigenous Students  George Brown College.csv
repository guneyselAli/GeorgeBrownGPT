Students can contact Lisa Zangerl (Lisa.Zangerl@georgebrown.ca) or Indigenous.Services@georgebrown.ca for information on tuition fees, books, and living allowances. The Métis Nation of Ontario (MNO) offers a bursary program initiated in 1998 and provides support and services for the educational success of all Métis across Ontario. Inuit students residing outside of the Northwest Territories or Nunavut for 12 consecutive months could be eligible for funding through the Post-Secondary Student Support Program. Eligible Inuit students seeking more information on how to apply for available funding for post-secondary education should contact Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation.

Financial aid offices within First Nations offer forms and policies for financial assistance, while the MNO provides information on scholarships and bursaries. Additional educational funding may be required for Indigenous students, and websites such as those listed below can help:

1705971358948098000," The George Brown College is building a mass-timber building named Limberlost Place at its Waterfront Campus. The building is expected to open to students in about a year. It will house the School of Computer Technology, the School of Architectural Studies, and a new child care center. Additionally, it will be home to the Brookfield Sustainability Institute (BSI), where George Brown College will work with partners on solutions to climate change-related problems.

The Ontario Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry, Graydon Smith, visited the construction site and participated in a mass-timber roundtable discussion. Industry experts from various sectors, including architecture, construction, education, engineering, forestry, land development, and others, attended the event. The challenges and opportunities of mass timber construction were discussed during the roundtable.

Limberlost Place will serve as the new home for several programs offered by the college, including computer technology and architectural studies. The BSI hosted the inaugural Toronto Mass Timber Conference in September 2021.

Some issues surrounding mass timber construction that were discussed include financing challenges for prefabricated building construction, using mass timber to address the housing shortage, and the need for mass timber education for industry and new tradespeople.",scraped_pages/otherpages/GBC hosts Ontario Natural Resources and Forestry Minister Graydon Smith and industry leaders for mass-timber roundtable | George Brown College.txt

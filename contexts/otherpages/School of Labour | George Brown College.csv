The School is governed by a Joint Board, co-chaired by the Presidents of the College and of the Labour Council. The commitment of both parties is to a socially progressive curriculum that respects working people and expands their access to post-secondary education. The mission of the School of Labour is to offer training and services to unionized workers and labour education to George Brown College students in coordination with the Labour Education Centre (LEC), which is the educational project of the Labour Council.

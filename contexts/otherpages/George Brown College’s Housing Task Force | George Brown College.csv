d518bc85-f42b-424b-9c20-db8fdbf66030," George Brown College (GBC) recognized the housing crisis in Toronto and established an internal Housing Task Force in February 2023 to research and define the scope of the student and employee housing crisis. In November 2023, they unveiled the results of the first phase of their work, which indicated significant demand for safe and affordable housing for the college's students and employees. The Housing Task Force will continue to evaluate GBC's assets and collaborate with external partners and housing experts to find solutions to the housing crisis.

The housing crisis in Toronto negatively affects student learning and well-being. A survey of GBC students received 770 responses, indicating that high housing costs result in longer working hours for students to pay rent, longer commute times as they move further out of the city, and heightened concerns about housing safety, particularly among international students. The average asking rent for a new lease on a two-bedroom apartment in Toronto in September 2023 was $3,411/month.

6af2efe0-488f-4bbc-9fca-d4efcb5165f6," The Honours Bachelor of Interpretation (American Sign Language-English) degree program at George Brown College is a four-year program. Students in their fourth year run and participate in a volunteer student interpreting service for low-risk social events. This service, previously known as the GBC Student Referral Service, provides access to more opportunities for students to practice their interpreting skills in authentic contexts. Students accept approved requests for volunteer interpreters and assign students to interpret requests. All requests must be approved by faculty in the program.

The service does not accept assignments where funding is available for professional interpreting services, nor for assignments that are beyond the scope and abilities of student interpreters or potentially harmful to students and consumers. Some agencies that typically pay for the service are listed, and requests from these agencies will not be accepted.

To request student interpreters, please email gbcvsis@gmail.com with the date and time of the event, location, nature/topic, and number of participants. There is no guarantee that students are available, and two student interpreters will always be sent to the assignment. Students do not accept payment for their work; instead, feedback forms are requested in lieu of payment.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Volunteer Student Interpreting Services FAQ | George Brown College.txt

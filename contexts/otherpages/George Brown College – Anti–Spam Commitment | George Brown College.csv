1705971359922090000," The College has modified its email footers to comply with Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL). CASL requires each Commercial Electronic Message (CEM) to have a functional unsubscribe mechanism, which must be processed within 10 business days.

The types of CEMs the College may send include messages about new business opportunities or ventures, if consent has been implied or expressly given, or if an exemption applies. Exempt messages include those from an existing employee via social media, if the recipient is connected to the employee on the social network or has indicated openness to receiving such messages, and if the message is in connection with their business role and function. Recipients may also receive CEMs if they have conspicuously published their electronic address and have not indicated that they did not wish to receive CEMs.

Recipients who believe they have received a CEM in error can contact the College at casl@georgebrown.ca to have their address removed from the list within 10 business days if required by CASL. The College takes privacy and compliance with laws seriously, and recipients may unsubscribe at any time from receiving CEMs by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the received message or managing their preferences in the Preference Centre.

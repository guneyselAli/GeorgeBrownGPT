0e0f350f-a2b5-4204-925e-9b764c1a169e," The Clinical Pre-placement Office at George Brown College is responsible for administering the health form process for students in the Community Services and Health Sciences (CSHS) programs. These students are required to meet certain medical and non-medical requirements specified by the college for clinical placements or practice settings in various schools including School of Social & Community Services, School of Dental Health, School of Health & Wellness, School of Health Services Management, Sally Horsfall Eaton School of Nursing, and Continuing Education programs.

Students are required to undergo a vulnerable sector police record check screening conducted by George Brown College in cooperation with Regional Police Service and RCMP before having direct contact with children or vulnerable people. Without a satisfactory police record check, students may not be allowed to participate in practicum assignments.

George Brown College has retained Registered Nurse services through ParaMed Extendicare for reviewing confidential Clinical Pre-placement Health Forms and supporting documents of CSHS students to ensure they meet academic program requirements and are eligible for clinical or field placements. Students are responsible for bearing the costs associated with completing health form requirements and Paramed services fees.

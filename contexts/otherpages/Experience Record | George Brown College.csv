It includes Experiential Learning and Work Integrated Learning courses completed by students, and allows them to search for opportunities to develop specific skills or connect with organizations. The goal is to help students reflect on their skill development and create accomplishment statements for their resume and interview responses. The text mentions that half of those surveyed in industries had trouble filling vacancies due to applicants lacking communication, adaptability, decision-making, and problem-solving capabilities despite having technical skills.

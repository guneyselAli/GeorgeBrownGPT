08098248-5ec6-484c-923e-60866c14af4b," The George Brown College conducts annual and comprehensive program reviews for diploma, certificate, apprenticeship, and degree programs to assess their strengths, challenges, and overall quality. A comprehensive review takes place every five to seven years, and a program reviewer leads the process with assistance from faculty, curriculum specialists, and academic managers. The Office of Academic Excellence manages a rolling three-year plan for reviews, considering strategic priorities, mandated accreditations, and other program-specific data. Shorter programs or those with lower enrollment or satisfactory performance may undergo a Program Quality Self-Assessment (PQSA) instead. PQSAs are written by program staff and submitted to their academic managers by April 30 of the academic review year. Annual program reviews are conducted by academic managers to ensure the programs remain relevant and up-to-date.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Program Review | George Brown College.txt

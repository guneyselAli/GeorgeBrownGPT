5f509d3d-5ef2-4a5e-9982-2734519d6a44," The Honours Bachelor of Digital Experience Design is a program created in consultation with industry, faculty, alumni, and students, providing specialized skills training and hands-on experience for the current and future job market. The curriculum is structured based on the digital experience design workflow, focusing on ""Think, Make, Ship"" groups of skills. Students will be able to work across the product development cycle by researching, conceptualizing, designing, prototyping, developing, testing, and commercializing digital solutions.

Lower-level courses (Years 1 and 2) teach foundational design skills, methods, and theory, such as Design Culture and Theory, Intro to Digital Experience Design, Design Thinking, and Research in Digital Experience 1 and 2. Courses like Design Tools, Drawing, Computing, Human Computer Interaction, and hands-on labs develop students' mastery of design skills and processes using hardware and software.

Throughout the program, students generate real-world digital experience design solutions, applying their knowledge in courses like Design Jam, which challenges them to create designs on short notice using agile development methods common in industry. Special topic courses focus on adapting to the latest trends, including IoT, Wearables, and the MUSH sector (municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals).

Entrepreneurship for Digital Design, Publishing & Distribution, and Commercialization expose students to business standards and ethics, as well as patenting and intellectual property concerns.

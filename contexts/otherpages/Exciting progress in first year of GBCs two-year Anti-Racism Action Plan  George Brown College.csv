The college has made significant strides in the first year (2022/23). Some of the initiatives include promoting continuous learning and growth among students and employees, examining practices and policies to ensure they align with values and commitments to indigenization, anti-racism, diversity, equity and inclusion. Notable accomplishments within the first year include unlearning and learning together, engaging in new approaches, and quiet work done by some individuals without fanfare. Jennifer Grant, Associative Vice-President of GBCâ€™s Office of Anti-Racism, Equity and Human Rights Services, acknowledged the collective engagement and collaboration from faculty, staff, departments, divisions and senior leadership for advancing this work. The next year will continue efforts to challenge and do more to advance the goals in the plan and hold accountability.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Exciting progress in first year of GBC's two-year Anti-Racism Action Plan | George Brown College.txt

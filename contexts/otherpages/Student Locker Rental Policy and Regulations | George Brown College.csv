1705973483286071000," The George Brown College has a Locker Program to provide full-time students with lockers for storing belongings during classes. Students are limited to one locker each and must vacate it at the end of their rental period for cleaning and reassignment. Rental fees are used towards student employment and maintenance. Lockers are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis at semester start and rental periods cannot be carried over. Students can extend rentals for consecutive semesters if needed. Those who take lockers without registering will have their locks cut and belongings removed without notice. Unclaimed items are stored for ten business days before being donated or discarded. Students who withdraw from full-time programs can request refunds within ten business days of the current term's start, but locked contents will be put in storage and must be retrieved by renting a new locker. Locker rental refunds can only be applied for until ten business days into the current term and any future rental terms. An email reminder is sent two weeks before the end of a rental term to vacate the locker, otherwise the lock will be cut.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Student Locker Rental Policy and Regulations | George Brown College.txt

* Locker cleaning occurs at St. James Campus at the end of each term.
* Students are responsible for their belongings in lockers; the College assumes no liability.
* There have been past break-ins, so students should exercise caution and not store valuable items in lockers (such as purses, wallets, laptops, cameras or music players). High-quality locks are recommended.
* The College reserves the right to access lockers at its discretion for security reasons or environmental concerns. Criminal activity will be reported to police.
* The last day to cancel a locker and receive a refund is the tenth business day after the first day of any semester.

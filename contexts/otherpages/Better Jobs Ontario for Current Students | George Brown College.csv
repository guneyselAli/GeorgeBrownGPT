George Brown College students sponsored under this program will receive ongoing support from the Community Partnerships Office, who will provide programs and services as well as regular updates from the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development (MLTSD). The deadline for students starting in September 2022 is July 16, 2022. Students are encouraged to identify reliable sources of information for various aspects of their educational experience, as both the College and MLTSD systems are large and no single department holds all subject matter expertise. For inquiries related to Better Jobs Ontario, students can contact the Better Jobs Ontario Program Officer. The phone number is 416-415-2000, and TTY is 1-877-515-5559, and email is ask.george@georgebrown.ca.

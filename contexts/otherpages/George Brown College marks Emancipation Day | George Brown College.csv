1705971358549763000," Emancipation Day is observed on August 1 to commemorate the abolition of enslavement for Africans, their descendants, and Indigenous Peoples in British colonies including Canada and the Caribbean in 1834. This day serves as a reminder of the painful history of enslavement and racism in Canada and acknowledges the enduring effects of anti-Black racism. It is a day to celebrate and appreciate the rich heritage of Black people in Canada, recognizing their struggles and contributions. The transformative power of liberatory movements extends beyond any single moment in time. August 1 was officially observed across Canada for the first time in 2021, although it has been celebrated in Canada since before then. Toronto's Caribbean Carnival, the largest Caribbean festival in North America, has roots in anti-colonial movements and emancipation celebrations from the Caribbean. Emancipation Day events have long been held in communities across Canada.

Events happening around Toronto to mark Emancipation Day can be found on the City of Toronto’s Emancipation Month page.

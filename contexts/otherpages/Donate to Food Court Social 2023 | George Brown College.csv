This program offers two streams of training: the Culinary Skills (Preparatory Training) Program and the Construction Craft Worker Foundations Program. Completion of the program results in students receiving an Ontario College Certificate and job placement support. The program is partially funded by the government and through fundraising efforts, specifically from events like the Food Court Social. 100% of net proceeds from the Food Court Social go directly to the Augmented Education program. The program functions during the pandemic and continues to serve students remotely. For inquiries, contact Samantha Walker at 416-415-5000 ext. 3005 or Samantha.Walker@georgebrown.ca.

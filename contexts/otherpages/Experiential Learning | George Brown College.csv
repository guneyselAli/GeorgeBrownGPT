1705971359036124000," The Centre for Business at George Brown College offers various experiential learning opportunities for students in different settings such as workplaces, simulation facilities, labs, shops, and studios. Some of the options include Work Integrated Learning (co-op or internships), Consulting Work Term, Field Education course, participating in competitions, joining business organizations, attending industry functions and events, and learning from expert guest speakers.

Co-op or Internships are available, some of which are paid and unpaid opportunities that allow students to apply their classroom learning on-the-job, providing practical experience and further developing skills. Diploma students can work for an employer in a preapproved job related to their program of study to earn a business elective credit, evaluated against agreed objectives determined in advance by the employer and faculty. Class projects may include developing marketing plans, creating online social media strategies or planning and execution of new apps.

Students have the opportunity to participate in applied research initiatives through the research and innovation office, working on field projects for clients in support of data-driven business decisions using the latest tools and technologies. They interact with clients, gather feedback, and make meaningful business recommendations.

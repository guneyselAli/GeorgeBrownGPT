7aa38d91-5f4a-4f05-979f-df20b3872f3f," The TLC (Teaching and Learning Commons) at George Brown College offers both in-person and online tutoring services. Appointments are booked through their booking program and last for 30-60 minutes. Students can have up to 1 hour of tutoring per day and per subject (English, math, accounting or study skills). Group appointments (up to 4 people) are welcome for one-on-one tutoring but not for online tutoring. TLC locations offer drop-in tutoring where students can drop-in and get questions answered or study until they have a question without booking in advance. However, time spent in drop-in does not add to the daily or subject-specific tutoring limits. Online tutoring works similarly to one-on-one tutoring but is done virtually. For more information on online tutoring, students can watch how-to videos provided on the website.

409a0c01-a710-4a96-b0a5-4a6164f385fb," The text discusses the management of records in the college, with a focus on transitory records. Transitory records are defined as documents or other items which have only temporary value and should be destroyed once they have served their primary purpose. Examples of transitory records include local copies of purchase orders and invoices. The departments responsible for the originating records should retain the official copies, while other duplicates are considered transitory records. The text advises against transferring or retaining transitory records in Archives, and instead they should be destroyed securely once they are no longer actively used. It is important to note that there may be exceptions where records could be deemed transitory but should actually be retained as official records due to their individual use or circumstances. For further questions, contact Clay Thibodeau, the college Archivist.

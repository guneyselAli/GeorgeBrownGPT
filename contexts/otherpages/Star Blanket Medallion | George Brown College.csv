1705971358635435000," The Indigenous Initiatives team unveiled a new medallion in October 2021, featuring a star blanket design created by artist Joseph Sagaj. The star blanket is seven-pointed and carries the seven original clans and the seven grandmother/grandfather teachings in Anishinaabe culture. Receiving a star blanket brings good dreams, prosperity, and protection. It represents legends, stories, events, and different perspectives of culture and heritage. The giver chooses colors that represent the individual to tell their story, show their personality, and reflect their accomplishments.

The star blanket is symbolic and holds deep significance in many Indigenous communities across Turtle Island as it accompanies its own origin story. The Creator's Eye is also represented by the star, which signifies safety and protection when the Creator is with you. The balance is incorporated into the design along with elements of Earth and Air. The people joined together in a circle represent all people from all walks of life.

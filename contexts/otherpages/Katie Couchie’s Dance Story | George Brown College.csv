9228dc5c-cb97-453d-a5d9-38cd4ef4f298," Katie is a ballet dancer who aspired to attend a professional ballet school when she was 12 years old. She took private lessons and attended summer intensive programs at the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and Quinte Ballet School, which led to her acceptance into Quinte's full-time program in 2012. Katie moved to Belleville to study at Quinte for her grade nine year but had to take a break from dance due to personal reasons. She went through therapy with her family and returned to dance a few years later, applying to George Brown Dance because of its relationship to Canada’s Ballet Jörgen. Katie is now pursuing her diploma in the George Brown Dance Performance program (P105). Her goals for herself moving forward in her dance career include sharing her ballet knowledge and skill with Indigenous communities by going to rural communities and doing workshops.

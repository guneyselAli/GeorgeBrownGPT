82f48ded-7778-4f44-a03d-049fbdd24040," The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) became law on June 13, 2005. The Ontario government developed mandatory accessibility standards under this act, which were consolidated into one regulation, the O. Reg. 191/11: Integrated Accessibility Standards, effective July 1, 2016.

The George Brown College (GBC) has an AODA Policy that outlines how the college will achieve its obligations and responsibilities under the AODA and its Standards. The policy is guided by the principles of dignity, independence, integration, and equal opportunity. The college has a dedicated committee called the George Brown College AODA Committee to address accessibility issues. This committee includes members who champion accessibility best practices, those accountable for implementing accessibility initiatives and AODA regulations throughout the college, and an AODA Coordinator who provides leadership and expertise in support of GBC's accessibility strategy.

The committee is responsible for activities such as reviewing the annual status report and the outcomes, deliverables, and activities stated in the college's multi-year plan. For more information about the committee, contact aoda@georgebrown.ca. The college's multi-year plan can be viewed on their website.

1705971359780990000," The School of Dental Health at George Brown College received a $50,000 donation from industry partner 123Dentist for the expansion project of their WAVE (Wellness, Applied Research and Visionary Education) Dental Clinic at Waterfront Campus. The project includes 24 standalone dental suites with floor-to-ceiling glass and ventilation technology to reduce the risk of virus spread from aerosol-generating procedures. 123Dentist has previously funded scholarships and hired graduates from George Brown College. One of the new dental suites was officially renamed in 123Dentist's honor during a cheque presentation celebration on January 4, 2023. The School of Dental Health is now prepared to meet future public health challenges with this upgraded facility, which is one of the largest dental clinic facilities in the Ontario college system.

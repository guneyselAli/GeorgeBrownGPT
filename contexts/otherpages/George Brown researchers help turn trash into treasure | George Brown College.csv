211b6a12-cd56-4ff8-9f2a-cbb385f2163c," Plastic Flux is a start-up in Toronto that transforms black plastic into functional furniture by shredding it and forming it into sheets. They approached George Brown's Product Development Exchange (PDx) lab to custom build the sheet press needed to press the shredded plastic into molds. The PDx helps companies design, build and test new products and services. The lead researcher on the project was John-Allan Ellingson, a faculty member in George Brown's Mechanical Engineering program. The original open-source designs for the sheet press were from an European initiative called Precious Plastic Community. However, Plastic Flux wanted to keep the production local and customized the design of the sheet press at PDx to make it safer and more ergonomic for industrial use. In Toronto, black plastic isn't accepted in the City's municipal recycling program, including takeout containers, garbage bags, plant trays, and flower pots, due to the optic sorting machine used by the City which can't process black plastics because the conveyor belt is also black. Plastic Flux saw this as an opportunity to make something beautiful from the wasted resource.

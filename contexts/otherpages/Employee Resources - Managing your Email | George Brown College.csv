Not all email messages are required to be retained; some may only have transitory value or personal information, and can be deleted. Other emails containing important business information should be kept for an extended period, filed alongside other documents, and printed if necessary. Examples of emails with corporate value include those that contain contracts, policies, minutes of meetings, and communications between staff and students. The retention period for such emails is the same as for paper/hard copy records.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Employee Resources - Managing your Email | George Brown College.txt

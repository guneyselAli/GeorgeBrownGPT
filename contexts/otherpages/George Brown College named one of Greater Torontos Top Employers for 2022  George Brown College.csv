7db0e354-98d3-4c9b-a10c-022867a382d8," George Brown College has been named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers for 2022 for the sixth consecutive year. The college was recognized based on eight criteria: physical workplace, work atmosphere, health, financial, and family benefits, vacation and time off, employee communications, performance management, and community involvement.

The college has adapted to the evolving needs of employees by launching the Return to Campus plan and the Future of Work initiative. To support employees' well-being and work/life balance, George Brown extended the Employee and Family Assistance plan to all employees, initiated Meeting-Free Fridays and employee wellness days (extra days off added to long weekends and holiday break), and continued to offer early leave on Fridays before long weekends.

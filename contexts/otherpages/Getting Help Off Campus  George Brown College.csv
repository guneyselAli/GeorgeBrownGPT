It explains that there are different types of professionals who provide mental health support, including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and psychotherapists. Here is a factual summary of the information provided:

* Psychiatrists are medical doctors with additional training to specialize in mental illnesses. They can diagnose mental health disorders and prescribe medication. Some psychiatrists also provide counselling or talk therapy.
* Psychologists have a PhD in psychology and can diagnose certain kinds of mental health conditions and provide psychological testing. They can also provide counselling or talk therapy but cannot prescribe medication.
* Social workers usually have a Master's degree in social work and can provide counselling or talk therapy. They often connect individuals to community resources and support networks and do not prescribe medication or provide official diagnoses.
* Psychotherapists have a Master's level degree in counselling and can provide counselling or talk therapy. They do not prescribe medication or provide official diagnoses.
* Counselling services at GBC are free of charge for registered students. Many community agencies and hospital programs also provide counselling free of charge or at a low cost. Some mental health professionals offer fee-for-service counselling, which is often called ""private practice."" If choosing a counsellor in private practice, it's important to ensure they are properly trained and have a professional designation such as Registered Social Worker, Registered Psychotherapist, or Registered Psychologist.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Getting Help Off Campus | George Brown College.txt
07d422cc-9ae0-494a-b3f3-b7cc6612af37," To receive medical services at George Brown College, you can see a family doctor at a walk-in clinic, a hospital, a family health team or other medical practices in the community. A family doctor can provide general medical services such as check-ups, vaccinations, diagnosis of medical conditions, and prescribe most medications. To access specialized medical care, such as a psychiatrist, for more complex medical conditions, you may need a referral from a family doctor.

To receive medical services, you will need either a valid provincial health card (in Ontario, this is called OHIP), some form of health insurance (at GBC this is available through We Speak Student), or pay directly for the care you receive. It's important to find out from the doctor ahead of time if your health insurance covers the services you are going to receive.

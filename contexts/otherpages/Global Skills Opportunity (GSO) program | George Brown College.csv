1705987052185989000," The George Brown College (GBC) participates in the Global Skills Opportunity (GSO) program, a Canadian initiative providing financial support for students participating in international learning experiences at home and abroad, whether virtual or in person. The goal is to help students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, develop intercultural competencies for success in a global workforce.

The GSO project is open to all Canadian post-secondary students but prioritizes Indigenous, low-income, racialized, and students with disabilities. Students must meet certain eligibility criteria: International students are not eligible for GSO funding but may be supported by GBC’s Global Mobility Bursary.

GSO provides funding for physical and virtual international learning activities lasting one week to one year, for which academic credit/recognition is given. The types of activities include all physical mobility experiences taking place outside Canada, with a preference for non-traditional destination countries. GBC has strategic partnerships with institutions in Brazil, China (including Hong Kong), Denmark, France, Germany, India, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Panama, Portugal, South Africa, South Korea, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, and the UK.

Participants may study or work in any destination but international experiences will not be permitted in countries with travel advisories from the Government of Canada recommending avoidance of all travel or non-essential travel. All outbound mobility programming is required to follow the Government of Canada’s travel advisories (https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories).

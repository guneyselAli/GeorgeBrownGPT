1705971358734440000," Racism is a complex issue rooted in a history of colonization and exploitation of racialized peoples. There are different types of racism including individual, institutional, systemic, and cultural/ideological.

Individual racism includes attitudes such as believing one race is superior to another and discriminatory behaviors manifested through bigotry, intolerance, hatred, and microaggressions.

Institutional racism is created through policies, practices, and procedures that may overtly or subtly discriminate against racialized peoples (example: talent acquisition processes).

Systemic racism refers to laws, rules, and norms interwoven into the social fabric of society, such as immigration laws and education and wage disparities between dominant groups and equity-deserving populations.

Cultural/ideological racism includes values embedded in dominant culture, such as Eurocentric concepts of beauty (example: western concept of beauty).

Anti-Asian racism is a type of racism directed towards people of Asian descent.

Racism leads to social and physical hostilities and assaults for racialized peoples.

Racism has historical roots in capitalism and colonization by European nations. It constructs definitions of racialized peoples in a negative light based on biological differences, establishing and maintaining political, social, and economic advantages and privileges for the dominant group (white/European descent).

To address racism, gaining a deeper understanding of its history and operation is essential, as well as emotional energy and commitment to anti-racism work.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Types & Forms of Racism | George Brown College.txt

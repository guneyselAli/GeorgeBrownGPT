7d865059-2cdb-48f8-a35e-e1eeb3fa34da," International students are foreign nationals who can request a change from international student fee status to domestic under specific circumstances, but this must be done prior to the start of term or program. International students are exempt from international student tuition fees under certain conditions at the time of enrollment in a college course or program. However, they must have a valid study permit during the academic period for which they have sought exemption, except for those with diplomatic status. Federal legislation regarding immigration and refugee status takes precedence if in conflict with fee exemption eligibility requirements. Students whose permits will expire partway through a semester should obtain an extension before the semester starts to be exempt from international fees for that semester. If a student meets a requirement for fee exemption eligibility partway through a semester, the exemption applies to the next semester of enrollment. If a student's status as someone eligible for exemption from international tuition fees changes partway through their program due to circumstances beyond their control, they will still be exempt from international fees for the previous semesters.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Changing Fee Status from International to Domestic | George Brown College.txt

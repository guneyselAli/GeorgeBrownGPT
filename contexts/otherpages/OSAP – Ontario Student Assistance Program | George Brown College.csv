3. Students with previous OSAP loans must ensure they are placed into interest-free status to avoid making payments within six months of ending their study period.
4. Students previously receiving full-time OSAP funding that are now repaying a loan or continuing in full-time studies need to submit an online CIFS application. The old CIFS form is no longer accepted.
5. If students have loans from another province or had part-time student loans including OSAP, a Schedule 2 form will be required to maintain interest-free status.

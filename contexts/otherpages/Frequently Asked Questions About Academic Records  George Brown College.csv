Students are advised to check back a few days or contact their Academic Department for inquiries. Grades will remain available on Stu-view for one year after graduation. To calculate the GPA, quality points are obtained by multiplying the grade point value of each letter grade with its respective credits, and adding all quality points to obtain the total quality points. The total quality points are then divided by the total GPA hours (credits) to get the GPA. A failed grade is included in the GPA hours but can be excluded if the student repeats the course and achieves a passing grade. Students have the option to repeat courses and only the highest grade will be included in their program and cumulative GPAs.

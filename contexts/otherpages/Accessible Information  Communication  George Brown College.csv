0b03c72b-0a8c-4483-a732-5bcf317e4aa7," George Brown College is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive environment for all employees, students, and community members. The college requires that content be accessible to individuals who are Deaf, Deafblind, deafened or hard-of-hearing, as well as those with diverse learning abilities and whose primary language is not English.

To ensure compliance with the college's Accessible Media Policy in accordance with the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA), content creators should consider the following accessibility features:

1. Closed captioning: Provide on-screen text of dialogues and other auditory information for audio-visual content. This option is typically indicated by the ""CC"" symbol within a video player.
2. Described video: Narrated voice-over descriptions of key visual elements necessary to provide context for individuals who are blind or visually impaired, such as setting, body language, and costumes.
3. Live captioning: Provide real-time captioning during live events, meetings, etc., using remote caption writers or captioners.
4. Screen readers: Use software that renders text displayed on a computer screen into a form that individuals who are blind or visually impaired can process, such as speech or braille output.
5. Transcription: Provide a verbatim transcript of the dialogue for content with an audio-only component, such as podcasts and audio recordings.

All video content, including recorded lectures, demos, webinars, etc., must be captioned*. This includes content found online via platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo. Auto-generated captions should be avoided since they are often inaccurate and not accessible to individuals who use screen readers.

Audio content, like podcasts, require a transcript in order to be accessible. To have content captioned, transcribed, or reviewed for accessibility, contact Anne Villahermosa, Accessible Media Coordinator at avillahe@georgebrown.ca. Described video is also available upon request; if you need described video for your video content, please contact Anne Villahermosa and provide a few weeks' notice.

*It is important to note that the asterisk (*) symbol in the text indicates that all video content must be captioned according to George Brown College's Accessible Media Policy.",scraped_pages/otherpages/Accessible Information & Communication | George Brown College.txt

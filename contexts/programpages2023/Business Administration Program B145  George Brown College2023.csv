b7b300d0-b743-4ac5-a0a5-25403b75c93b," The Centre for Business programs at George Brown College are part of the School of Management and have earned international recognition from the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP). A total of 14 diplomas, advanced diplomas, and degree programs in Accounting & Finance, HR, Management, and Marketing have been accredited. George Brown College is one of only two colleges in Ontario with ACBSP accreditation.

The college has adopted a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) initiative, requiring students in the Centre for Business program to bring their own laptops. Open access computers are available at the Library Learning Commons, as well as equipment that can be borrowed on a short-term basis. Students interested in work experience should apply to B155, which offers on-the-job experience and field education opportunities with real-world challenges and clients.

Graduates of the program are prepared for various administrative and management positions and have found employment as assistant managers, customer service representatives, financial services representatives, project managers, project coordinators, and sales associates. To graduate from the B145 program, students must complete 36 courses: 27 mandatory courses, 6 business electives, and 3 general education electives. Depending on placement test results, students may be required to take COMM 1000 (Introduction to College Communication) or MATH 1027 (Business Math with Remediation) before progressing to higher-level courses.

Placements are scheduled for two days per week in the second half of semester 2, totaling 84 hours. Students will observe and participate in hands-on practice during each placement.

The program covers topics such as working with deafblind individuals, supporting those with complex medical needs and aging, ASL, alternate communication methods, professionalism, values and ethics, sighted guide, and interacting with members of the Deafblind community both virtually and in-person. For those attending from outside the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), interactive sessions will be arranged in their community.

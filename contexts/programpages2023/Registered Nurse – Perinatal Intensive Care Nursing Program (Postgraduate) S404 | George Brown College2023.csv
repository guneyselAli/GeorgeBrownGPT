3ff55854-78eb-4d82-a8c6-40ec968b0def," The George Brown College offers a Full-time RN-Perinatal Intensive Care Nursing program with two learning streams: Standard (15 weeks) and Accelerated (15 weeks).

The Standard learning stream is for registered nurses who have no experience in neonatal nursing. It begins in September and January, and students attend synchronous-learning classes three full days a week. The theoretical component consists of lectures, case studies, and expert guest speakers. Completion of two clinical courses is mandatory.

The Accelerated learning stream is for nurses with at least one year of current experience caring for neonates. It also starts in September and January. Students participate in online interactive classes twice a week for discussion and facilitation of learning theoretical concepts. Class attendance is strongly recommended, but recordings will be available. Nurses can apply for Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR) to receive credit for one or both clinical courses within the Perinatal program based on their NICU experience.

All students use a theory manual and a textbook. Faculty are available to support learners through class, online meeting platforms, email, telephone, and tutorial support. Clinical courses take place in Level II and/or Level III neonatal intensive care units. Students must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 for clinical placements, as required by public health and hospital partners.

Clinical placement is a significant component of the Registered Nurse – Perinatal Intensive Care Nursing program. Learners will practice under the supervision of a clinical teacher or preceptor in Level II and/or Level III hospital neonatal intensive care units to develop specialized knowledge, nursing assessment skills, and clinical competencies.

Career opportunities after completing the program include various roles within Perinatal Intensive Care Nursing.",scraped_pages/programpages2023/Registered Nurse – Perinatal Intensive Care Nursing Program (Postgraduate) S404 | George Brown College2023.txt

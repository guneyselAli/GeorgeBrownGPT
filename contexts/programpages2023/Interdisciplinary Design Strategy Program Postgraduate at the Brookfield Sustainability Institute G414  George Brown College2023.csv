d4752d71-0b8a-4a5e-8d7e-d9afb3cc7822," The BSI (Bachelor of Design in Interdisciplinary Studies) program at George Brown College is a research-based program that focuses on fostering new talent with the ability to think systemically, collaborate, and build sustainably. Students will engage in interdisciplinary learning, developing applied research and innovation projects tackling real-world sustainability challenges alongside community and industry partners.

Strong candidates from various fields such as architecture, engineering, design, planning, economics, art, and science are accepted into the program. The goal is to produce a new breed of designer who embodies the qualities of an artist, inventor, mechanic, objective economist, and evolutionary strategist (as described by Buckminster Fuller).

Throughout their studies, students will learn skills such as how to ask questions, listen, research, work with images, engage others, communicate ideas, be a leader, work with others, make mistakes, take risks, and throw away good ideas. Additionally, students may have opportunities for international travel to collaborate with communities around the world (examples include Costa Rica, Chile, Italy, Ireland, New York City, and Chicago).

Some notable projects completed by the Institute in previous years include Massive Change: The Future of Global Design (2003-2004), which resulted in a book and travelling exhibition; The World House Project (2006-2009), exploring sustainable housing systems for Canada and Costa Rica; City Systems (2009-present), examining the complexities of urban life; and Regional Ecologies (2013-present), looking at urbanization as a regional phenomenon.",scraped_pages/programpages2023/Interdisciplinary Design Strategy Program (Postgraduate) at the Brookfield Sustainability Institute G414 | George Brown College2023.txt
de5df1c1-5ff5-463b-b487-dddac6f49a83," The Institute without Boundaries (IwB) initiated research on ""Regional Ecologies"" in 2016-17, focusing on ""symbiotic regions"" and partnering with Waterfront Toronto. In 2017-18, they worked with Toronto Global, Neptis Foundation and the Institute for Competitiveness and Prosperity to rethink Toronto Region as a unified economic region. From 2018-2022, their focus was on ""Future Ways of Living"" as a research method and call to action for anticipatory design. In 2022, the IwB transformed into the Brookfield Sustainability Institute (BSI), a global solutions studio for smart sustainable solutions to fight climate change.

Graduates from Interdisciplinary Design Strategy at the Institute without Boundaries may find employment in various organizations such as not-for-profits, cultural institutions, government, private corporations, and consulting services. Some recent graduates have secured employment worldwide in organizations like Doctors without Borders, Art Gallery of Ontario, IDEO in California, Ministry of Culture (Costa Rica), Frog Design (New York) and Bruce Mau Design.

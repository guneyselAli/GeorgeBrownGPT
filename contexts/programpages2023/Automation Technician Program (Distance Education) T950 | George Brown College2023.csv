1706007694677418000," The Automation Technician program offered by the college focuses on industrial automation including digital electronics, process control, SCADA systems, programming of PLCs and robotics. Students will learn about applications and examples of automated manufacturing systems through interactive curriculum using text, 2D and 3D animations, photos, audio clips and lab simulations. The program includes 18 modules with an average completion time of 32 weeks, but there are no strict time limits.

One of the main features of this program is the integration of theory with laboratory projects using LogixSim, a suite of software products providing ""real world"" simulation of electricity, electronics, robotics and PLCs. Career opportunities after completing the program include roles as Automation Technicians who design, install and maintain equipment in the field of industrial automation and control.

Upon completion of the Automation Technician Certificate program, students may continue their studies and pursue a Certificate in Electromechanics, PLCs or Robotics through www.emcourse.com, www.plctechnician.com or www.onlinerobotics.com respectively.

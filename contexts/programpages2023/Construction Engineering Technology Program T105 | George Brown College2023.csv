19221430-33d9-4fac-84f1-2abcd5164e22," The Angelo DelZotto School of Construction Management offers a Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) degree program with a focus on areas such as construction planning, project management, site superintendancy, estimating, budget and bid preparation, sustainable building science, and engineering studies. Students who enroll in the program in January are required to complete semester 2 in the summer (May to August) of the same year to continue into semester 3 in the fall.

Field education and experiential learning options can be obtained by contacting the Angelo DelZotto School of Construction Management for updated information. A co-op stream following semester four is anticipated to be offered with selective entry, check with the school for more details.

The construction industry in Ontario and the GTA generates over 360,000 on-site and off-site jobs, pays over $22 billion in wages, and creates almost $43 billion in Ontario’s built environment. The expanding regional transit network and population demographic shifts have led to high demand for housing and significant construction activity.

Pathways to the Construction Management degree program are available after completing the three-year Construction Engineering Technology program with a minimum GPA of 3.0. For more information, see the Transfer Guide.

The required courses for semester 1 include BLDG 1025 - Surveying for Construction Technology, BLDG 1126 - Print and Specifications Reading for Construction Technology 1, and BLDG 1127 - Construction Management. Please note that the program is undergoing current review, and courses after year 1 are expected to change in the 2023-24 year.",scraped_pages/programpages2023/Construction Engineering Technology Program T105 | George Brown College2023.txt

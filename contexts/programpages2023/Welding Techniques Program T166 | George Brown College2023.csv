9bccee74-55d3-454f-9914-d30e6156e467," This intensive two-semester program offers students hands-on experience in various welding processes, allowing them to challenge the shielded metal arc weld test (voluntary and at an extra cost) based on CSA W47.1/W59 standards through the Canadian Welders Bureau at its completion. Students will master the following five welding processes:

1. Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW): Primarily used in maintenance and repair industries, it employs a consumable electrode covered with flux for iron, steel, and alloys.
2. Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) / MIG Welding: One of the easiest types to learn, it uses electricity to melt metals together, suitable for carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, magnesium, copper, bronze, etc.
3. Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) / TIG Welding: Using a non-consumable tungsten electrode with inert gas protection, it is commonly used for welding stainless steel and non-ferrous metals like aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys.
4. Plasma Arc and Oxyfuel Cutting: Utilizes an electrode and compressed gas to cut metal primarily in mild steel, stainless steel, and aluminum, with oxyfuel cutting using fuel gases combined with oxygen.
5. Metal Fabrication: The process of constructing structures from various raw materials, increasing marketability and knowledge in the industry.

Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities:
Graduates can explore various career options, increasing their marketability and knowledge within the welding industry.",scraped_pages/programpages2023/Welding Techniques Program T166 | George Brown College2023.txt

1705971360769407000," The text provides information about a full-time, hybrid Dental Hygiene program offered by the college which is OSAP eligible. To qualify for this program, applicants must be actively registered to practice dental hygiene with the College of Dental Hygienists of Ontario and have a minimum of one year of dental hygiene work experience.

The program covers various topics including application of bonding systems and liners, placement and finishing of composite and amalgam restorations, taking final impressions, fabrication and cementation of provisional restorations, and cementing and bonding indirect restorations. Students will practice procedures on a manikin and perform restorative and cosmetic procedures on clients in the on-site WAVE Dental Clinic.

Students interested in furthering their career beyond clinical practice can consider applying to the Bachelor of Science (Dental Hygiene) (S305) fully online program, which is the first of its kind in Ontario and requires just three semesters to complete.

The text mentions that clinical experience is a key component of the program, and during semester 1, students focus on developing pre-clinical placement skills and practice restorative skills exclusively on manikins. In semester 2, students get hands-on practice performing restorative procedures with clients on-site at the WAVE Dental Clinic under the supervision of qualified oral health-care professionals. Observation of a restorative dental hygienist also takes place off-site with their current employer and/or a community field placement partner, upon approval by faculty.

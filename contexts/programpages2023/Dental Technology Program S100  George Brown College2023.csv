d29f2a5d-5ee7-4667-8023-05f0c52863d5," The text describes a dental technology program offered by the college. In this program, students learn to use various tools and technologies to create oral devices prescribed by dentists. They will work with full dentures, partial dentures, crowns, bridges, implant-regulated restorations, orthodontic appliances, and other specialty items. Students have the opportunity to practice in on-site high-tech dental labs.

Graduates of this program are eligible to apply for the Canadian Alliance of Dental Technology Regulators (CADTR) Dental Technology Entry to Practice Assessment (DTETPA) and the College of Dental Technologists of Ontario to obtain a Certificate of Registration. However, without this certificate, graduates may only work as a lab technician under the supervision of a Registered Dental Technologist.

The program has an external field component in year three, where students spend two days a week in class and three days per week off-site at an external professional laboratory for approximately 21 hours per week. Students are responsible for organizing their own external lab experience with approval from the program.

Interested students who need to improve their marks can consider enrolling in the Pre-Health Sciences Pathway to Advanced Diplomas and Degrees (A108) program as a precursor to this dental technology program.",scraped_pages/programpages2023/Dental Technology Program S100 | George Brown College2023.txt
73e268e5-6077-4ba0-842a-22d3740b79df," The text provides information about a diploma program offered by the college with a focus on biology, chemistry, physics, and communication. Graduates of this program are eligible to apply for the national entry to practice assessment with the Canadian Alliance of Dental Technology Regulators (CADTR) and upon successful completion, can apply for a General Certificate of Registration from the College of Dental Technologists of Ontario (CDTO), which allows them to work as Registered Dental Technologists (RDTs).

RDTs have various career opportunities such as practicing the full scope of dental technology in a commercial dental laboratory or in a dental office, owning and operating a dental laboratory that services oral health professionals, supervising the practice of dental technology performed by dental lab associates, branching into other positions like educators and consultants, and shaping the regulation of dental technology.

Without obtaining a Certificate of Registration in Ontario, graduates may work as dental lab associates under the direct supervision of an RDT or dentist or sales representatives with a dental supply company. The text also mentions the required courses for the first semester, including ANAT 1010 (Functional Anatomy), ANAT 1068 (Head and Neck Anatomy), DENT 1026 (Complete Denture Construction I), DENT 1030 (Orthodontics I), DENT 1150 (Introduction to Dental Technology), COMM 1000 (Introduction to College Communication), a General Education Elective, and BIOL 1004 (Microbiology).

3c81dfb5-61b7-4e4d-a429-d57dab6783df," The program offers a Behavioural Science Technician designation with a focus on applied behaviour analysis (ABA) and behavioural intervention. The themes in the program include behavioural theory and application, program development, scientific method, ethics and professionalism, diversity, and general education with practical application.

Practicum and course work relate to developmental disabilities, acquired brain injury, gerontology, and behavioural disorders. Travel may be required for field education due to opportunities in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), including Oshawa, Burlington, and Vaughan.

The Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) has verified specific courses within the program for eligibility to take the Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst® examination. Students are required to complete two intensive field placements in semester 3 and semester 4, each lasting seven weeks. Placements will be conducted with a variety of populations and agencies dealing with autism, mental health issues, acquired brain injury, developmental disabilities, behavioural concerns, or aging-related issues.

Graduates can find employment in various settings related to autism, developmental disabilities, intellectual disabilities, brain injury, gerontology, and behavioural disorders. Career options include ABA therapy programs, schools, hospitals, residential and treatment facilities, and vocational agencies.

The program consists of the following required courses:

Program Learning Outcomes:
1. Implement effective behaviour analytic intervention strategies based on the science of Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) in order to increase desired behaviours, teach new skills and decrease contextually problematic behaviours.
2. Integrate background information and knowledge of special populations into therapeutic practice, in order to develop behavioural interventions using a behaviour analytic approach.
3. Communicate with various stakeholders the behaviour analytic principles, processes and concepts central to the interventions being provided in order to enhance quality of service.
4. Compile measurements of behaviour in accordance with the ONTABA standards of practice and the Behavior Analyst Certification Board's Guidelines for Responsible conduct in order to conduct behavioural assessments and develop behavioural interventions.
5. Apply systems thinking to behavioural processes related to socially significant behaviour change in order to ensure the sustainability of behaviour change programs that increase an individual’s quality of life.
6. Adhere to federal, provincial and professional policies and regulations associated with the ethical practice of Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) among various populations or service sectors.
7. Apply input gained from collaboration with stakeholders (including individuals, family members and community members) and professionals in the field of service into effective client service intervention.
8. Develop a reflective practice, using professional development and self-care strategies to enhance professional competence.
9. Develop client-centred behavioural intervention plans that account for individuals’ rights, needs, goals and their social and community context.
10. Integrate the conceptual and philosophical underpinnings of behaviour analysis into a comprehensive case.",scraped_pages/programpages2023/Behavioural Science Technician Program (Accelerated) C156 | George Brown College2023.txt

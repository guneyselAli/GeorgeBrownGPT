The themes studied in this program include behavioural theory, behavioural assessment, behavioural acquisition and reduction strategies, scientific method, ethics and professionalism, and general education with a practical application in the field. Students can find employment opportunities as behaviour science technicians upon completion of the program. For those with a bachelor's degree in psychology or related discipline, an accelerated delivery of this program leading to a diploma is offered in less than one year.

Associations related to this field of study include the Association of Behaviour Analysis International, The Ontario Association for Behaviour Analysis, Inc., and Association of Professional Behavior Analysts. Students can also visit the Behavior Analyst Certification Board for more information on this field of study.

The field placement component of the program provides students with the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world environment. Each field experience builds upon the previous one and provides exposure to various work environments. Field placements are unpaid and completed on a full-time basis, and George Brown Faculty works with students and community partners to secure these placements. Field education may require travel due to the availability of suitable placements within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), potentially extending as far east as Oshawa and as far west as an undisclosed location.

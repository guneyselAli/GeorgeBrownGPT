The program lasts for four years and focuses on seven areas of learning: language and culture, field fundamentals, interpreting skills, research methods/trends, ethics and professionalism, breadth electives, and field and community experience. Students with a diploma or advanced diploma in American Sign Language-English interpretation can apply for an advanced entry option. The program aims to develop interpreters who are critical thinkers with unbiased communicative language and interpreting practices and an understanding of how intersectionality shapes interactions, using an anti-oppressive framework situated through Deaf-centric foundations.

To be a successful interpreter, one needs a strong command of both English and American Sign Language, an excellent memory, the ability to concentrate and focus for long periods, quick cognitive processing skills, multitasking abilities, versatility, flexibility, strong communication skills, and excellent interpersonal skills. Students will participate in field placement experiences and work in various group settings.

1705971360558881000," The text provides information about a ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC/R) advanced diploma program offered at George Brown College. In the first two years of the program, students study residential and some light commercial systems. In the third year, there is an additional focus on commercial systems. The curriculum covers air system and hydronic (water) theory, design distribution systems, selecting appropriate fans, pumps, heating and cooling plants, and system controls for larger buildings. The program follows industry-standard design practices for environmentally responsible and energy-efficient residential, commercial, and industrial systems, as established by the Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Institute (HRAI), the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and the Canada Green Building Council.

Upon completion of the program, students have sufficient training to challenge the Gas Fitter 2 provincial qualification exam and obtain the Gas Fitter 2 certification. In the third semester, they are assisted in preparing to challenge the Ontario Ministry of Consumer Affairs and Housing HVAC House exam to obtain a Building Code Identification Number (BCIN). The text notes that there are further requirements to qualify for the BCIN beyond passing the HVAC House exam. Successful graduates may find employment opportunities in consulting engineering and architectural firms, design/build contractors, school boards, commercial refrigeration installation and maintenance companies, building automation and control companies, building maintenance, HVAC/R manufacturing, sales, and distribution companies, as well as management careers or self-employment.

The star blanket is seven-pointed and carries the seven original clans and the seven grandmother/grandfather teachings in Anishinaabe culture. Receiving a star blanket brings good dreams, prosperity, and protection. It represents legends, stories, events, and different perspectives of culture and heritage. The giver chooses colors that represent the individual to tell their story, show their personality, and reflect their accomplishments.

The star blanket is symbolic and holds deep significance in many Indigenous communities across Turtle Island as it accompanies its own origin story. The Creator's Eye is also represented by the star, which signifies safety and protection when the Creator is with you.

Partners range from small community organizations to large downtown Toronto hospitals and healthcare facilities.

Advances in technology are transforming healthcare, with data playing an important role. Information systems collect, store, and analyze health care data for effective and efficient treatments, research projects, and new methods of diagnosing and treating diseases. Tools facilitate telemedicine, online registration, family healthcare teams, and insights into mental health, cultural diversity, etc.

Security and confidentiality of electronic health data is a foundational aspect. Students study government legislation like PIPEDA and FIPPA.

Students are equipped with business skills for inter-professional health care teams, learning industry-specific computer programs at the Daphne Cockwell Centre for Health Sciences.

Individual racism includes attitudes such as believing one race is superior to another and discriminatory behaviors manifested through bigotry, intolerance, hatred, and microaggressions.

Institutional racism is created through policies, practices, and procedures that may overtly or subtly discriminate against racialized peoples (example: talent acquisition processes).

Systemic racism refers to laws, rules, and norms interwoven into the social fabric of society, such as immigration laws and education and wage disparities between dominant groups and equity-deserving populations.

Cultural/ideological racism includes values embedded in dominant culture, such as Eurocentric concepts of beauty (example: western concept of beauty).

Anti-Asian racism is a type of racism directed towards people of Asian descent.

Racism leads to social and physical hostilities and assaults for racialized peoples.

Racism has historical roots in capitalism and colonization by European nations. It constructs definitions of racialized peoples in a negative light based on biological differences, establishing and maintaining political, social, and economic advantages and privileges for the dominant group (white/European descent).

To address racism, gaining a deeper understanding of its history and operation is essential, as well as emotional energy and commitment to anti-racism work.",What is the historical background of racism?

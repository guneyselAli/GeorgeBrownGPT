Program Description
Leadership Claims
Preparing students to work with individuals and communities toward progressive social change for more than 40 years.
The Community Worker program is one of the few programs of its kind in Canada.
Program Overview
George Brown College's Community Worker (C101)
program prepares students to work for progressive social change with organizations, communities and individuals across a range of issues such as poverty, housing, legal rights, discrimination, food justice, immigration and refugee settlement.
Full Description
George Brown College's Community Worker
(C101)
is a two-year, four-semester Ontario College Diploma program that integrates local and global perspectives within a multi-level understanding of the historical, social, political, economic and systemic ways in which social issues have developed, and are experienced by communities.
Grounded within social justice and human rights, we provide students with the critical analyses, knowledge, skills and attitude required to work with diverse and historically marginalized individuals and communities on a range of concerns.
This is an approved education program by the
Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers (OCSWSSW)
. Graduates of this program may apply to receive the additional designation of RSSW (Registered Social Service Worker). Extra fees may apply.
Community Worker Program Features:
Strong ties with more than 350 agencies across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).
Twenty-plus-year relationship with Anishnawbe Health Toronto (AHT).
Graduates of AHT’s Community Health Worker Training Program can gain direct entry into the second year of the Community Worker program.
Founder and lead organizer of the annual Tommy Douglas Institute, which brings participants together to explore community, education and social justice in the twenty-first century.
The Role of a Community Worker
Emerging from a proud history of community-based organizing, advocacy and activism, community workers work with individuals and communities at all levels (local, national, natural and global) toward positive social change.
Community workers are committed to the full and equal inclusion of all peoples within societies that value equality, diversity and human dignity. The pursuit of social justice is about rights—not charity; working in solidarity
with
communities—not for them.
Key Skills Taught in the Community Worker Program
Throughout the program, students will have the opportunity to develop a variety of important and high-demand skills, including:
anti-oppressive and intercultural practice in working with diverse populations
critical analysis, research and writing
group facilitation, counselling and leadership development
community organizing, activism and advocacy
community development, project design and proposal-writing
policy analysis and rights-based advocacy
Community Worker Program Structure
The program combines classroom instruction with
two supervised field placements
.
Theory, analysis and practice are presented through a variety of innovative instructional tools developed from popular education and learner-centred approaches to teaching and learning.
Highly participative classes of dialogue, debate, interactive lectures, guest panels and group activities provide students with a program of study that is current, exciting and critically engaging.
Program Courses Are Organized into Four Core Areas:
community work theory and practice
social and political analysis
group skills and counselling
field placement and seminar
Community Worker Faculty
Faculty are experienced educators who bring their passion for education and change to create a highly engaging and dynamic learning environment. Coming from backgrounds in local, national, and global activism, they remain active on social issues and maintain close ties to communities, activists and organizations.
Community Worker Students
From mature students to high school graduates, from newcomers to those hoping for a career change, our diverse and committed student body is a core strength of our program.
If you are passionate about human rights and social justice, committed to working with diverse communities, and bring a mature and professional approach to your education and fieldwork, this is the program for you.
In preparation for the field placement, students will be required to work in multiple small and large groups within classes and community settings.
Already have a diploma or a degree? Visit the
Community Worker (Accelerated) program
page to see if you are eligible.
Your Field Education Options
Students will develop relationships with our community partners through field placements, and in their classrooms through networking events, guest panels. Program option courses are often taught by practitioners currently working in the field (e.g., Community Legal Issues, Urban Aboriginal Peoples: Perspectives in Community Development, etc.).
Types of Community Worker Field Placements
Students will have the opportunity to develop practical skills and gain valuable professional experience by completing field placements in semesters 2, 3 and 4.
Through our strong ties to community partners and advocacy organizations, students can find placements suited to their specific interests and on a wide range of issues such as poverty, settlement services, housing, food justice, education, HIV/AIDS, Indigenous services, arts-based agencies and anti-violence.
Note
:
In compliance with the requirements of our field partners, all students in this program are encouraged to complete a Police Vulnerable Sector Check before commencing their field placement. These reference checks, which can take up to four months, are done to protect the clientele of these agencies who are considered “vulnerable persons” under the law. The fees for the reference checks vary by region and must be paid by the student. Students are responsible for ensuring that the check covers appropriateness for “individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s).”
The program will assist students in applying for the police check once they begin the program.
Students without a clear police reference check may find that their choice of placement is limited. Students in this situation are encouraged to work with the field education co-ordinator to identify placement opportunities that do not require the vulnerable sector check. Students are also encouraged to inquire and apply for Suppression and Destruction of Record or Record Suspension (formerly known Pardon) at their specific regional police services, in order to prepare for their future career or employment.

Clinical Pre-placement website

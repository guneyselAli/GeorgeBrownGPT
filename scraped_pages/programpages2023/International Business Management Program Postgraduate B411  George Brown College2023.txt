Starting in a new country is never easy; luckily for me, I landed in the right place. George Brown College feels like home with every interaction I have, no matter if I’m speaking with staff, colleagues or friends. The college gave me the opportunity to develop my professional skills by working as a Peer Coach and later on as the Marketing Coordinator for the Career Services Centre, an opportunity offered for my co-op term. I’m proud to be a George Brown International Business Management AND Strategic Relationship Marketing graduate.

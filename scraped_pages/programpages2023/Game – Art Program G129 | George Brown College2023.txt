Full Description
Video games have become one of the leading forms of artistic expression in the twenty-first century. Game development requires a combination of talents, hard work and passion. The
Game-Art
three-year advanced diploma is a rigorous program of study that focuses on the principles and techniques of video game art creation required to break into the industry.
As a student of this program, you will develop both two-dimensional and three-dimensional artistic abilities by learning concept art, sprite and pixel art, modelling, texturing, animation and level design. Taught by faculty with industry experience and mentored by local game industry leaders, you will develop games for commercial, educational and other purposes.
You will have the opportunity to develop commercial-quality games in a simulated video game studio environment, at times working with industry partners and game programmers. In the second year, you choose whether to specialize in game modelling or game animation.
Before graduation, you will assemble a portfolio/demo of your creative work demonstrating your ability in game development and highlighting your chosen area of specialization. It is anticipated that graduates of the Game Development program will find employment in the game industry at entry-level positions.

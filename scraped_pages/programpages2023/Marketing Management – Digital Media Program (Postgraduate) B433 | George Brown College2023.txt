Your Field Education Options
Work Experience (co-op or internship work term)
This program requires the successful completion of a one-semester work experience term to graduate. This work experience is either co-op (paid) or internship (unpaid). Either one will give you the practical experience employers value.
The work term occurs after the end of the second academic semester.
George Brown works with employers and industry partners to identify potential work experience opportunities. Students then apply for these opportunities and go through a competitive interview process. Students are also strongly encouraged to pursue self-directed industry work experience opportunities they believe will provide the learning experiences they value and meet the learning outcomes of the program. This valuable work experience can in turn be added to your resumé.
In addition to on-the-job work experience George Brown College endeavours to provide field education opportunities with real world challenges and clients. Find out more about

Program Description
Leadership Claims
This Child and Youth Care program has earned national accreditation from the Child and Youth Care Educational Accreditation Board of Canada, becoming the first of its kind in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and the third in Canada to do so.
Program Overview
George Brown College's Child and Youth Care (C133)
program teaches students the skills they need to work effectively with children, youth and families who are experiencing social, emotional, developmental and behavioural challenges. The program integrates a holistic approach embedding an ecological perspective and principles of human rights, anti-oppressive practice, resiliency and restorative practice.
Full Description
George Brown College's Child and Youth Care (C133) program
combines best practice principles and a relational approach that is anchored in the values of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Ontario Association of Child and Youth Care Code of Ethics.
Students learn to engage purposefully and effectively with children, adolescents and families who struggle with emotional, behavioural and developmental challenges that impair their abilities to relate to others.
Specific focus is on recognizing the impact of mental health challenges on children and youth.
Students learn to translate theory into practice to move youth from potential risk to resilience.
In preparation for the field or clinical placement, students will be required to work in multiple small and large groups within classes and community settings.
Your Field Education Options
Field placement plays an important role in the Child and Youth Care program.
During the first year, students will learn foundational skills that they will develop as the course progresses.  The subsequent academic courses come to life in a wide range of
supervised field placements in the second and third years of the program
.
Second-year students can expect to be in placement two days a week (winter semester) and third-year students can expect to be in placement three days a week over 28 weeks (includes both the fall and winter semesters).
Placements may take place in professional settings such as:
residential care
hospitals
shelters
schools
after-school programs
community outreach programs
day treatment
youth justice
Students are expected to work both day and evening shifts (not overnight) and may be requested to work on some weekends.
Students are able to apply for
Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition
for one field placement.

Special Requirements
Clinical Pre-placement health form requirements and program policy
Upon confirmation of acceptance into this program, students must meet and complete all the mandatory requisite health form requirements for this program. This will take up to 10 to 12 weeks to complete.
Students will need to process and provide proof of their medical records such as (MMR, Varicella, Hep B blood test reports/titers, Tdap shot valid every 10 years, Two Step TB Skin Test and COVID-19), a clear Police Vulnerable Sector Check renewed every year,
Standard First Aid certificate
renewed every three years and
CPR level C
renewed every year. These requirements must be submitted by the given deadline to
ParaMed.
Students who do not comply with the program’s health policy and requirements will not be eligible to attend and are excluded from the field practicum, which may jeopardize their academic standing and unable to graduate in this program.
All costs, service fees and fines associated with the overall health requirements are the responsibility of the student.
To download the mandatory requisite health form and for more details, go to the
Pre-placement website
.
Police Vulnerable Sector Check requirements and program policy (renew every year)
In compliance with the requirements of our placement partners, all students in this program are required to have a
Police Vulnerable Sector Check
completed, and this check must be renewed annually before entering into field or clinical placement.
The Police Vulnerable Sector Check process typically takes two to three months, but under some circumstances can take four to eight months. This is required to protect the clientele of our placement partner agencies, who are considered “vulnerable persons” under the law.
Students are responsible for ensuring that the Police Vulnerable Sector Check covers appropriateness for “individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s).”
Students are required to keep the original copy of their Police Vulnerable Sector Check.
Students who are unable to provide a “clear” Police Vulnerable Sector Check may not be able to start their field or clinical placement and therefore may be unable to complete the program. Students who are not eligible to attend their practice placement due to a “not clear” status will jeopardize their progress in the program. Our agency partners have the final decision for students being allowed to practise in their agency.
Failure to meet the requirements for field placement will prevent students from completing the program and/or securing employment.
The fees for the police record check vary and must be paid by the student. For more information, please visit the
Pre-placement website
.
Students are required to successfully complete a Ministry-approved crisis-intervention training certificate in their fifth semester.
Our field placement partners may require students to show proof of vaccination. It is your responsibility to ensure all pre-placement requirements are met.

"I always wanted to be an advocate for children and youth. I met a victim services worker who told me about the program at George Brown. Knowing that I wanted to specialize in child abuse prevention and intervention, I felt that the courses in this program would help me set the foundation for my educational path. I also knew that I wanted to continue pursuing higher education and that Ryerson had a direct entry program, which allows George Brown students to apply to go directly into third year. These reasons and the fact that George Brown provided 2 full-year placements made me choose this program at George Brown."

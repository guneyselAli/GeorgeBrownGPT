Special Requirements
Pre-placement Health Form
Upon confirmation of acceptance into this program, students must meet all the mandatory pre-placement health requirements for the program. It may take up to four months to complete all the requirements.
All costs, service fees and fines associated with the overall health requirements are the responsibility of the student.
For further details and to download the mandatory pre-placement health form, go to the
pre-placement website
.
Students will also be required to be carded for "mask fitting" and to provide proof of flu immunization.
Police Vulnerable Sector Check
In compliance with the requirements of our placement partners, all students in this program are required to have a police vulnerable sector check completed, and this check must be renewed annually before entering into clinical or administrative placement.
The police vulnerable sector check process typically takes two to three months, but under some circumstances can take four to eight months. This is required to protect the clientele of our placement partner agencies, who are considered "vulnerable persons" under the law.
Students are responsible for ensuring that the police vulnerable sector check covers appropriateness for "individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s)."
Students are required to keep the original copy of their police vulnerable sector check.
Students who are unable to provide a "clear" police vulnerable sector check may not be able to start their clinical or administrative placement and therefore may be unable to complete the program. Students who are not eligible to attend their practice placement due to a "not clear" status will jeopardize their progress in the program.
Failure to meet the requirements for clinical or administrative placement will prevent students from completing the program and/or securing employment.
The fees for the police record check vary and must be paid by the student. For more information, please visit the
pre-placement website
.
Health Policy
Students should be aware that various allergens including nuts, dairy and shellfish are routinely used in practical labs. Students should also note that George Brown College is sensitive to religious observances; however, while products purchased for production and consumption meet all provincial and federal regulations, they may not meet specific dietary laws related to halal and kosher foods.

"Being in the culinary field for almost a decade, I wanted to propel my career to the next level. I decided to pursue a postgraduate diploma in Food and Nutrition Management. George Brown College was the obvious choice for me. I had interactions with industry professionals in the past who were alumni of the college and I have nothing but admiration and respect for them all. The values and learning acquired at George Brown permeate the industry and sets the standard very high. The program was challenging and intensive but it absolutely put me in a position to succeed in a management role. Professors and guest speakers alike were practicing industry professionals who disseminated current and relevant industry insight that was useful and invaluable to my career advancement. Being Canadian Society of Nutrition Managers (CSNM) accredited, the program is highly recognized throughout the industry!"

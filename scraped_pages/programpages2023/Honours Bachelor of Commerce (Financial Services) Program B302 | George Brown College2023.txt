I was able to take the Canadian Securities Course as part of my degree. Also, the program prepared me to write the Certified Financial Planner exam right after graduation, which saved me a lot of time.
My education helped me to move up at TD very quickly, much faster than I would have without it. George Brown was the right choice for me. I would recommend the program to anyone.

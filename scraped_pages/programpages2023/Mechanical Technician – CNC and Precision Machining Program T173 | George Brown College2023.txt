Program Description
Program Overview
This 2-year program is eligible for
a $40.000 scholarship.
*
This Mechanical Technician program integrates precision machining methods with advanced computer-controlled machine technology (CNC) in state-of-the-art Precision Machining, CAD/CAM, CNC, Research and Robotics Labs. Students design and manufacture tools, jigs, fixtures, precision fabrication assemblies and prototypes using computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing software, precision machining equipment and sophisticated CNC machine tool technology. In their final year, students augment their learning by engaging in a 15-week co-op placement with industry partners.
*Domestic students only — see page for details.
Full Description
Graduates from this program benefit from a combination of advanced machine-tool technology principles (CAD/CAM/CNC) and extensive hands-on manufacturing practices that better prepare them for the technical challenges they may face in the workplace.
In their final year, students engage in applied projects to design and fabricate prototypes using digital manufacturing technology (laser cutters, 3D printers, multi-axis CNC machine tools).
All students will augment their technical training with courses in mathematics, communications and general education.
Your Field Education Options
Students will complete a mandatory 15-week co-op term in Year 2 following the final semester of classroom studies.

After graduating from the Mechanical Technician program in 2000, Andrew Lindsay went on to become the inventor of a patented engine controller for Blutip Power that helps mining companies conserve fuel and improve the environment. With customers on four continents at six of the world's largest mining companies, the controller works on massive diesel-powered engines to save fuel burn rates by about five percent, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve operations through digital data collected by the device. For many years, Lindsay and his brother produced Lindsay Lights, a computerized, music-synchronized holiday light show that raised over $70,000 for local charities, won international awards and was featured on the TV show

Industry Feedback:
"George Brown's Project Management field education course has allowed us to work with students on new projects that would have otherwise been delayed. The PM students, who had great talents and a diverse work and academic background, used their project management tools and planning processes skills to help the
Retail Council of Canada
develop important operational procedures in membership and event management.
"I would strongly recommend private and not-for-profit businesses take advantage of this valuable program that offers students real-life projects to test their skills for a career in project management and that also benefit participating companies."
Diane J. Brisebois
, president and CEO, Retail Council of Canada

Program Description
Program Overview
Specialization in building automation is an emerging and growing employment opportunity, especially in the construction and property development sector. We will provide the skills and knowledge you need for building science, building automation systems, networking and project management and green building. Upon graduation, you will be prepared for jobs in the industrial/manufacturing sector and will have the skill set expected by the construction and property development sector.
Builders and property managers require people to design and integrate building control systems such as lighting, telephony, security, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC), air quality, energy consumption and fire and safety. They need technologists familiar with a centralized approach, who can manage and control a building from an interface that provides building-wide efficiency, cost-effective operations and information-sharing.
Full Description
Building automation systems don't just control the basics: they regulate airflow, monitor energy use and are integrated with security, lighting and other building systems to deliver comfort, safety, energy efficiency and sustainability. Today’s buildings are increasingly complex, and they differ in use and size, but also in operating hours, comfort levels and environmental conditions. Offices, residences, hotels, schools and administrative buildings all have different requirements. Optimal building services technology is the result of appropriate systems design and integration during planning, construction, commissioning and operation.
This advanced diploma program in Building Automation provides students with the technical skills they need for success in the job market. Students learn to:
install, program, adjust and maintain building automation systems
program and install sensors, actuators and controllers
collect data for use in real-time or for archiving in a central server
work with building software platforms that interconnect different systems
Graduates will have a diverse set of skills and abilities that will also prepare them for "green" careers focused on energy efficiency, renewable energy and the environment. This program provides a skill set that is in high demand in both the construction industry and the controls and automation industry.
INDUSTRY SKILLS
Safety practices in the installation and troubleshooting of HVAC/R systems, including applicable codes and standards of the NEC, ASHRAE, OSHA, EPA and other regulatory bodies.
Basic HVAC/R processes and the function, layout and operation of commercial HVAC/R systems.
Functions, operating characteristics and applications of the control loops and control modes in digital, analog and pneumatic commercial control systems.
Blueprints and manufacturer’s technical instructions for installing or servicing a sensor, controller, actuator and related relays and power supplies.
General-purpose software and specific building automation software that monitors and controls HVAC/R and electrical systems.
Various BAS controls and systems, including DCS, PLC, PAC and SCADA.
Functions of network devices and protocols, such as a bridge, router, gateway, hub, firewall, twisted pair, Ethernet, TCP/IP, Zigbee, WiFi, BAS/IP and BACnet.
Emerging green technologies, such as solar, wind and hydronic, and how they can be integrated into building systems and residential applications.

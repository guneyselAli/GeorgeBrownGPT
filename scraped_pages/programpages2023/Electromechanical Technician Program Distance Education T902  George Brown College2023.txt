Program Description
Program Overview
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS
This online distance program
does not qualify for study/work permit (including PGWP) eligibility in Canada.
The Electromechanical Technician Certificate program provides a complete introduction to electronics and electromechanical systems. This program is often of interest to people who want to study electronics with an emphasis on mechanical systems, for example, someone coming from a millwright background. The program covers mechanical topics outside of a typical electronics program, like industrial control devices, DC and AC motors and control circuits, transformers, analog and digital transducers, industrial process control and PLCs.
ADVANCED STANDING
If you have finished the Electronics Technician program, you are exempted from 18 modules of the Electromechanical Technician program.
Full Description
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS
This online distance program
does not qualify for study/work permit (including PGWP) eligibility in Canada.
This is a Distance Education program in which you complete all courses (modules) by studying at home, with an interactive learning package on a personal computer. Laboratory projects and exercises are also carried out in this way. The learning materials, provided in a web-based downloadable file format, with 24 courses (modules) contain text, audio, 2D and 3D animations, computer-based testing and CircuitLogix and 3DLab simulation software.
You may enrol at any time during the year (open-enrolment) and complete the modules in the learning package at your own speed. The typical completion time is 34 weeks, but there are no time limits.
PREREQUISITES
Ontario Secondary School Diploma (with credits at or above general level) or equivalent or mature student status.
ADVANCED STANDING
If you have finished the Electronics Technician program, you are exempted from 18 modules of the Electromechanical Technician program. You may also apply credits toward the PLC Technician program, the PLC Technician II program, the Robotics Technician program and the Automation Technician program.
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
The program prepares you to work with machines having complex hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, computer, programmable logic and electronic controls. The skills acquired through this program enable you to install and test this type of equipment, advise on its maintenance and provide solutions to technical problems related to control systems in general.
The training and knowledge that you gain from this program enable you to work in fields such as industrial maintenance, design and installation as well as technical services, technical sales and industrial research and development.

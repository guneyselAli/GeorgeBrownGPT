Full Description
The
Interactive Media Management
graduate certificate program responds to a growing need within the design industry for a new skill set – one that crosses the traditional disciplinary boundaries of advertising, industrial, graphic and new media design.
This program empowers you with the latest real-time interactive tools and technologies. With the integration of these technologies into public and commercial settings, such as museums and retail environments, as well as the education and medical sectors, designers need to be armed with key knowledge of interface design, information visualization and virtual spaces. They have a mission to create friendly systems and interfaces that dramatically improve the lives of consumers and sellers alike.
The program combines design education with software instruction and hands-on workshops to configure interactive design strategies using existing and emerging display technologies. You will be exposed to best-practice examples and real-world models. You are encouraged to generate a unique design strategy and test it through an applied project directed toward the development of a fully functional, interactive demonstration prototype ready for a public audience.

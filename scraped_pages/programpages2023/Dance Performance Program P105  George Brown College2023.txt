Program Description
Program Overview
Dance Performance is a rigorous and high-standard two-year diploma program that prepares ballet and contemporary dancers to launch a performance career in professional dance.
Full Description
This rigorous and comprehensive two-year
Dance Performance
diploma program provides you with the necessary skills to launch a career in dance. As a graduate, you will be a classical ballet and/or contemporary dancer with the professionalism, technical expertise and industry contacts required to pursue a career in dance. With a choice of specialty in classical or contemporary dance, students train in ballet, modern and jazz with studies in acting, vocal, repertoire and composition to elevate their overall performance quality and marketability.
There are two streams for students to specialize in either classical or contemporary dance:
The
Classical stream
is for intermediate/advanced ballet students and includes more advanced training in ballet and pointe.
The
Contemporary stream
is for intermediate-level ballet students and includes additional contemporary training and the option of less advanced pointe classes.
Student Selection
Entrance requirement is dance training at the intermediate classical ballet level with pointe work and experience in other dance forms. Prospective students must pass an audition in ballet and jazz as well as an interview.

Courses
Required Courses
In order to graduate, you must successfully complete all of the required credits and appear in the semesters 2 and 4 showcases.
Showcase rehearsal hours will be scheduled in semesters 2 and 4 and are categorized as in-class mandatory homework hours. There will be between 2 and 10 hours of rehearsal per week, mostly during semesters 2 and 4, until each showcase performance. Production week at the theatre may also require additional hours.
At the time of your course selection,
you will be required to choose between Pointe classes or Dance & Physicality classes.
Once you have made your choice for semester one, you cannot switch between specializations in future semesters as you will not have earned the prerequisite grade required.

“As a dancer who wants to dance all the time, GBD is “the dream”. Students get to dance pretty much all day, which allows you to spend valuable time training and practicing. I knew how important ballet was for fundamental dance training and we received this training daily. Students are also trained in contemporary, jazz dance, vocals, acting, composition and choreography. The program targets every point of the spectrum of dance you will need to become a professional.”

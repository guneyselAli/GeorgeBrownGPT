Program Description
Program Overview
A design isn’t finished until someone is using it. Interior Design is a three-year program that prepares you to be a valuable member of the design team for interior additions and renovations, leasehold improvements and new construction. There is an opportunity to be part of the competitive co-op program in the third year. Students prepare for a career as an interior design technologist, someone who contributes to the technical design of building interiors by developing 2D and 3D presentation and construction drawings incorporating a knowledge of building code, sustainability, accessibility, lighting, textiles, furniture, colour and ergonomics.
Full Description
The three-year Interior Design advanced diploma program prepares you to be an Interior Design Technologist. You will be a valuable member of the design team for building retrofits, renovations and new construction, contributing to the technical design of building interiors by design development of plans, elevations, renderings and 3D models.
Learning in state-of-the-art interior design studios with the most up-to-date equipment and software, you will develop a thorough knowledge of interior design and technical design skills.
Through the application of interior design theory, you will learn how to effectively communicate the applied and technical principles of interior design. As a graduate, your area of specialization might include, but is not limited to, the following:
bathroom and kitchen design/build
commercial, retail or manufacturing technical sales
fitments, colour or texture finishes selection and consultations
2D and 3D computer drawing, design, rendering and modelling
sustainable interior design practices for commercial, retail and residential
Note: If you enrol in the program in January, you are required to complete semester 2 in the summer (May to August) of the same year in order to continue into semester 3 in the fall.
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
Opportunities for Interior Design Technologists vary within the AEC industry. Career options available to graduates of this program may include, but are not limited to, the following:
junior interior designer
computer-aided technical and presentation drawings and modelling
technologist with builders, architectural and interior design firms
technical representative for building/equipment suppliers
specification Writer
project coordinator
design and colour consultant for builders and retail outlets
staging for real estate and film industry
Graduates of this program will be interior design technologists who, with experience and a government Building Code Identification Number, will be legally able to design interiors of buildings. You may work independently as a self-employed interior design technologist or interdependently as part of an interior design or multidisciplinary architectural or building development team.
With experience and ongoing professional development, graduates will be able to enhance their professional competence and expand their scope of work. There are employment opportunities in the interior design industry, government and public organizations, with careers in the design of building interiors and systems, fittings and furnishings, staging, preparation and interpretation of material specifications and drawings, sales and marketing, purchasing operations, field and customer service and management of interior design projects.
Future Study Options
This program shares the first two semesters with the three-year Architectural Technology program (T109) and graduates may qualify to transfer with advanced standing in the second year of the
Architectural Technology program (T109)
. This would provide successful graduates with a dual advanced diploma.
Qualified graduates may be eligible for advanced standing in the George Brown College Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) degree program. For more information, see

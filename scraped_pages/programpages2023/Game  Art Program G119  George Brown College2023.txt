Video games have become one of the leading forms of artistic expression in the twenty-first century. Game development requires a combination of talents, hard work and passion. The
Game - Art
three-year advanced diploma is a rigorous program of study that focuses on the principles and techniques of video game art creation required to break into the industry.
As a student of this program, you will develop both two-dimensional and three-dimensional artistic abilities by learning concept art, sprite and pixel art, modelling, texturing, animation and level design. Taught by faculty with industry experience and mentored by local game industry leaders, you will develop games for commercial, educational and other purposes.
You will have the unique opportunity to develop commercial quality games in a simulated video game studio environment, at times working with industry partners and game programmers. In the second year, you choose whether to specialize in game modelling or game animation.
Prior to graduation, you will assemble a portfolio/demo of your creative work demonstrating your ability in game development and highlighting your chosen area of specialization. It is anticipated that graduates of the Game Development program will find employment in the game industry at entry-level positions.

“At George Brown my professors were all people who worked, or are still working, in the industry allowing me to learn about it in its current form. Even now, working in the industry myself, some of the professors I had are now my coworkers. They taught me all the aspects of the development pipeline on top of my specialization helping me work comfortably between departments in the studio. Most importantly, I not only learned the software I need but learned how to learn, enabling me to quickly adapt to all sorts of complex and proprietary software and engines.”

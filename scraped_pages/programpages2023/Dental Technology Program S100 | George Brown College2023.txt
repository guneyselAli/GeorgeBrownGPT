Program Description
Leadership Claims
Preparing graduates to work as dental technologists for over 20 years. This program is unique in Ontario.
Program Overview
Students in the Dental Technology program will develop the specialized skills of a dental technologist including how to design and fabricate various oral devices that have been prescribed to a patient by a regulated dental practitioner (often a dentist). Throughout this program, you will learn to make a range of dental appliances such as full dentures, partial dentures, crowns, bridges, implant-related restorations, orthodontic appliances and other specialty items. This program is unique in Ontario.
Full Description
The
Dental Technology program
will prepare you to work in the field of dental technology. If you want to work in the dental industry but don’t necessarily want to engage directly with client care, consider this profession. We recommend that you have an eye for detail, enjoy working with your hands and have good hand-eye coordination.
We’ll teach you to use a variety of tools to create oral devices that are prescribed by regulated dental practitioners (often a dentist). You’ll learn how to use specialized hand tools, moulds and the latest technology to make oral devices that are as unique as the individuals you will be creating them for. You’ll practise your skills in our on-site high-tech dental labs as we teach you to create:
full dentures
partial dentures
crowns
bridges
implant-regulated restorations
orthodontic appliances
other speciality items
Watch this video to learn how specialized 3D scanners and printers are changing how dentures are made.
Graduates of this program are eligible to apply to take the Canadian Alliance of Dental Technology Regulators (CADTR), Dental Technology Entry to Practice Assessment (DTETPA) and apply to the
College of Dental Technologists of Ontario
to obtain a Certificate of Registration.
(Note: Additional fees apply.) Without a certificate, graduates may work as a lab technician under the supervision of a Registered Dental Technologist. See
cdto.ca
for further information about registration with the College of Dental Technologists of Ontario.
Your Field Education Options
As this is a very hands-on profession, in-class practical laboratory assignments play an important role in helping to prepare students for the real-world work ahead.
In preparation for the external field component in year three, students will learn and practise skills in all areas of the dental laboratory, from introductory skills in model work to advanced digital dentistry procedures.
During semester 6, students will spend two days a week in class and three days per week off-site (approximately 21 hours per week) at an external professional laboratory. This experience provides students with a professional networking opportunity and the chance to practice their consolidated skills in a real-world setting.
PLEASE NOTE: Students are required to complete the pre-placement health form and organize their own external lab experience, and must have program approval prior to starting.
Interested in this program but need more competitive marks? Consider enrolling in the
Pre-Health Sciences Pathway to Advanced Diplomas and Degrees (A108) program
. This pre-program will help you develop new and strengthen existing skills in math, biology, chemistry, physics, and communication.
PLEASE NOTE: While successful graduates of the (A108) program will be eligible to apply to this advanced diploma, it does not guarantee entry into this program.
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
Graduates of this program are eligible to take the national entry to practice assessment with the Canadian Alliance of Dental Technology Regulators (CADTR) and on successful completion apply to the
College of Dental Technologists of Ontario (CDTO)
to obtain a General Certificate of Registration and become a Registered Dental Technologist (RDT). (NOTE: Additional fees apply.) Graduates can gain experience in various practice settings and by obtaining the RDT designation can advance to positions with more responsibility. RDTs are trusted and valued health professionals who play a key role in the oral health community of care.
See
cdto.ca
for further information about a Certificate of Registration with the CDTO.
Upon obtaining a General Certificate of Registration in the province of Ontario, RDTs may:
Practice the full scope of dental technology in a commercial dental laboratory or in a dental office.
Own and operate a dental laboratory that services oral health professionals.
Supervise the practice of dental technology performed by dental lab associates.
Branch into other positions such as educators and consultants.
Shape the regulation of dental technology by sharing subject matter knowledge on CDTO’s Council, Committees and programs.
Without obtaining a Certificate of Registration in the Province of Ontario, graduates may work as a:
dental lab associate under the direct supervision of an RDT or dentist
sales representative with a dental supply company

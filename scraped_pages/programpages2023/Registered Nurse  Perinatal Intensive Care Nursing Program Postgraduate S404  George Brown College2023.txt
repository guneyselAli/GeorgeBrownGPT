Special Requirements
Pre-placement Health Form
Upon confirmation of acceptance into this program, learners must meet all the mandatory pre-placement health requirements for the program. It may take up to four months to complete all the requirements. Please initiate this process upon acceptance of offer of admission.
All costs, service fees and fines associated with the overall health requirements are the responsibility of the learner.
For further details and to download the mandatory pre-placement health form, go to the
Pre-placement website.
Learners must submit proof of a satisfactory medical examination before entering field placement. Learners who are unable to provide a clear medical examination result to the college will not be able to start their field placement and therefore will be unable to complete the program.
Police Vulnerable Sector Check
In compliance with the requirements of our placement partners, all students completing a clinical placement in this program are required to have a Police Vulnerable Sector Check completed, and this check must be renewed annually before entering into field or clinical placement.
The Police Vulnerable Sector Check process typically takes two to three months, but under some circumstances can take four to eight months. This process is required to protect the clientele of our placement partner agencies, who are considered “vulnerable persons” under the law.
Learners are responsible for ensuring that the Police Vulnerable Sector Check covers “individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s).”
Learners are required to keep the original copy of their Police Vulnerable Sector Check.
Learners who are unable to provide a “clear” Police Vulnerable Sector Check may not be able to start their field or clinical placement and therefore may be unable to complete the program. Learners who are not eligible to attend their practice placement due to a “not clear” status will jeopardize their progress in the program.
Failure to meet the requirements for field placement will prevent learners from completing the program and/or securing employment.
The fees for the police record check vary and must be paid by the student. For more information, please visit the
Pre-placement website
.

"As a Registered Nurse already working in a level II NICU, I was itching to do more, experience more, and learn more. To help me achieve my goal I decided to choose the Perinatal Intensive Course at George Brown College. It was the best decision I ever made. Right from the start, I knew that taking this course would make me a better nurse and overall a better person – professional and personally.
The program was a short 15-week program divided into in-class lectures, hands-on clinical days, high fidelity simulation labs and lectures from speciality staff from SickKids. The program catered to and incorporated all types of learning. We got a chance to learn from the NICU clinicians. There were days when each subspecialty would come in to give a lecture – whether it was the dietician, surgical NP, genetic counsellor, bioethicists, RTs, etc. The program was delivered in various forms such as online lectures, workbooks, textbook readings, case studies, clinical skills learning package, simulation labs, journals references, group discussions, etc.
Heather (program professor and co-ordinator) is absolutely phenomenal. She is very knowledgeable about the program and helped me with every step up until the start date. Jennifer also teaches this course in collaboration with Heather. Jennifer made teaching so simple and easy to understand! Our clinical instructor, Sasha, was exceptional. I was able to complete my tasks in the NICU feeling safe, and supported throughout.
This program is unique in the way that it is built. It is well organized and structured. There is a flow in the way the material is taught. I particularly liked the connection that could be made while learning the theory and being able to apply it simultaneously in the practice setting. I would highly recommend this program for anyone new to the NICU world or even to those who have a few years under their belt. The time, money, and effort endured while doing this program will not disappoint. It helped me connect the dots in all the things I was seeing, and knowing why it was happening and what my role is as a NICU nurse. I have seen and felt an increase in my confidence and nursing skills. I am able to use my critical thinking skills and judgement gained from this course in all levels of the NICU.
To all the people I met during this program, thank you for allowing me to achieve my dreams of working in the Sickkids NICU – I appreciate it! I learned a tremendous amount of information that I will cherish for the rest of my nursing career as a neonatal nurse."

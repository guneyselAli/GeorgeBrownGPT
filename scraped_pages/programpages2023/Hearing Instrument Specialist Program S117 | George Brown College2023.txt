Program Overview
George Brown College's Hearing Instrument Specialist (S117)
program will provide you with the opportunity to study and develop the clinical skills you need to test hearing, select appropriate hearing instruments and dispense these aids to those in need. For applicants with a relevant degree or diploma, we offer an opportunity for advanced standing into semester 3 of the program.
Full Description
George Brown College's Hearing Instrument Specialist
three-year advanced diploma program will teach you the clinical and people skills you need to work in this field. If you are looking for a career that combines the latest technology and working with people in a health-care environment, consider applying to this program.
While hearing loss is not exclusive to the elderly, it does often occur as we age. With Canada's population rapidly growing older, the demand for
highly qualified hearing instrument specialists
who can provide a
client-centred approach
to better hearing health care will continue to increase in the coming years. If you are looking for an in-demand career that combines technology, with health care and people, consider this program.
You'll study the hearing instrument sciences to build a strong foundation in the theory and skills related to:
acoustics
audiometric testing
selection and fitting of hearing aids
hearing aid technology
You will develop clinical skills to not only
test hearing,
but
to select and fit hearing aids.
You will also develop the soft skills you will need to work with a variety of clients, all of whom experiencing some form of hearing loss. Skills like active listening, empathy and effective communication to help you connect with your clients and better understand their unique needs.
You'll also be encouraged to develop an entrepreneurial mindset through additional courses that address  key contemporary topics, including:
clinic management
health promotion
counselling
Earn this Advanced Diploma in Two Years With an Existing Credential
Applicants who have successfully completed a bachelor’s degree or a diploma in a Health Sciences, Social Sciences, or a related field, with an overall average of B minus (or 2.7 GPA or 70 per cent) may be considered for advanced standing into semester 3 of the program.
Your Field Education Options
Field placement is a key component of this Hearing Instrument Specialist program as it will allow you to apply what you've learned in the classroom to the work you will do with real patients.
This program offers both an internal and an external placement during semester 6.
Initially, you will conduct a 21-hour placement on-site at our state-of-the-art
WAVE Hearing Clinic (Hearing Clinic IV
). During this time you will practise treating members of the public, including George Brown students, by performing the day-to-day tasks of a hearing instrument specialist (e.g., testing hearing, fitting hearing aids and providing client counselling).
In the second half of the final semester, you will work off-site with a community partner for seven weeks (equivalent to 245 clinic hours) and will once again perform the day-to-day tasks of a hearing instrument specialist.
PLEASE NOTE:
As a student in this program, you will be responsible for finding your own field experience opportunities. You will be supported in this process by program faculty.
External field education generally occurs in the broader Greater Toronto Area, so travel will be required. You should be aware that field education opportunities may be located anywhere within the province, especially if suitable opportunities cannot be found in Toronto and surrounding areas. You will be responsible for travel and other associated costs related to external field education opportunities.
Interested in this program but need more competitive marks? Consider enrolling in the
Pre-Health Sciences Pathway to Advanced Diplomas and Degrees (A108) program
. This program will help you develop new and strengthen existing skills in math, biology, chemistry, physics and communication.
PLEASE NOTE: While successful graduates of the (A108) program will be eligible to apply to this advanced diploma, it does not guarantee entry into this program.

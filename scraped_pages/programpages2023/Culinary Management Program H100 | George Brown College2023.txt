"I am extremely grateful to George Brown College that as an international student from Jamaica, I was exposed to classical, contemporary North American and South Asian cuisines. I am very grateful for all the assistance and support provided to me by the chefs and the staff at the International Centre. I am now working at the Delta Hotel as an apprentice cook and I couldn’t have done it without the great mentors at George Brown College."

Full Description
This Early Childhood Education program is currently offering a $2,000 tuition grant to domestic students starting in September 2023.*
George Brown College's Early Childhood Education (Accelerated) (C160) program allows students to complete this diploma program more quickly by studying for 16 consecutive months from September 2023 through December 2024, with no breaks in between.
In this 16-month, continuous ECE Diploma program, you will learn how to support children as they grow. You’ll study the physical, cognitive, social and emotional development stages of infants (from six weeks), toddlers, preschoolers and school-aged children (to 12 years) and will learn to recognize key behaviours associated with each developmental stage.
You'll learn to design curriculum for child-centred, play-based learning in a variety of early childhood educational settings and will develop skills to respond to each child's unique needs and interests as they grow and develop.

Your Field Education Options
Field placement plays an important role in this ECE (Accelerated) program as it provides a continuum of experience that gives students the opportunity to build on their learning as they develop skills and progress through the program.
We approach teaching and learning in this program by alternating blocks of classroom theory with field practice. By providing regular intervals for students to apply the theoretical knowledge they are learning with practical, hands-on experience, it helps you build effective skills as an ECE practitioner and as a leader. Employers value this approach because it prepares our graduates to work as early childhood educators on day one.
Our Early Childhood Education students complete a seven-week field placement in each semester of the program. During this time, students have the opportunity to work with children of different age groups in a variety of settings.
To support student learning outcomes and ensure you have access to facilities that model the best practices we consider essential, we own and operate Ontario's largest network of school-run child care centres that serve over 1,100 children and their families each year. These
12 child care centres,
located across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), will expose you to the kinds of environments where you will eventually work and provide valuable services to the families and communities that they serve.

Program Description
Leadership Claims
Ontario's first internationally accredited four-year degree program specializing in construction management.
Program Overview
The Honours Bachelor of Technology in Construction Management program offers those with a three-year advanced diploma in Construction Engineering Technology, Civil Engineering Technology, Architecture Technology, Interior Design Technology and Building Renovation Technology to pursue a degree in the field.
All semester 4 courses must be completed successfully (i.e., achieve a grade of C- in all courses and a semester GPA=2.70) before registration in semester 5 of the Honours Bachelor of Technology in Construction Management program.
Bridging courses are scheduled to be completed as an intensive block during the spring/summer semesters (May to August).
Full Description
T314 – Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) is a degree completion pathway designed for graduates of an Ontario college advanced (three-year) diploma program in Architectural Technology and Interior Design Technology who wish to pursue a degree in Construction Management. Students completing this pathway are required to complete Year 3 and Year 4 of the program to obtain their bachelor's degree in Construction Management.
The Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) program provides a curriculum that combines theory, applied research, field study and hands-on practical education. Recognizing that today's successful construction manager must possess both technical and managerial skills, the curriculum combines studies in construction engineering and technology with studies in business and management methods as applied to construction.
Students obtain the knowledge and skills to manage the functions and processes of construction projects from start to finish. They master construction-related technical disciplines and soft skills that are critical to completing projects on time and within budget. Graduates of this program are entitled to the academic credential designation of
Hons. B.Tech
.
(Construction Management).
The Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) program is well recognized by the construction industry and is fully accredited by the Canadian Institute of Quantity Surveyors (CIQS).
Graduates also qualify to obtain their Gold Seal Certification (GSC), offered by the Canadian Construction Association (CCA) to become certified superintendents, foremen, estimators, project managers, owner's construction managers and safety practitioners.
Your Field Education Options
FIELD EXPERIENCE
An integral component of the Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) degree program is a mandatory field experience semester offered in the spring/summer of the third year of the program.

CONSTRUCTION MANAGERS NEED SPECIALIZED SKILLS TO SUCCEED
In this rapidly changing and growing industry, more and more highly trained construction managers are needed – managers who can effectively function within multidisciplinary teams of owners/developers, project managers, architects, engineers, planners, government authorities, contractors and trade contractors. In addition, the industry needs construction managers with a comprehensive knowledge of construction safety and quality management systems and sustainable construction practices. The construction industry also requires professionals who possess a broad technical and business management background that allows them to coordinate multidisciplinary teams and liaise with various stakeholders.
Construction managers plan, organize, lead and control construction projects from start to finish, according to design, regulatory compliance requirements, contracts, specifications, budgets and schedules, with a focus on sustainable construction techniques and practices.
ACADEMIC ACCREDITATIONS

Graduates also qualify to obtain the Gold Seal Certification (GSC) offered by the Canadian Construction Association (CCA). The Gold Seal Certification in the Canadian construction industry is available for superintendents, foremen, estimators, project managers, owner’s construction managers and safety practitioners. Gold Seal Certification is based on the candidate’s education, training and professional work experience.
Industry
The Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) degree is well respected in the construction sector. Here's what sector leaders had to say about our program:
"The introduction of the Construction Management program at George Brown College is the next stage of development of professionalism in the construction industry. For the first time, the industry has its own degree-specific program that brings together the two most important elements identified by leading construction executives – the science of construction and the science of management."
Temple Harris
, Vice-Chairman, Gillam Group
"In order to provide the necessary leadership, we need to staff our projects with construction professionals. Therefore, we believe the four-year degree program in Construction Management at George Brown College is an important component to ensure our continual requirement for construction professionals will be met."
Christopher Rick
, PCL Constructors, Canada Inc.
"As the industry expands and continues to change, it is imperative that individuals overseeing and managing construction projects are properly trained in all facets of the business."
James Zippel
, General Manager, Electrical Service & Projects, Ainsworth
"Producing future graduates who already have the necessary construction-specific skills as they start their careers will only help strengthen the long-term success of our industry."
Greg Kozicz
, President, Alberici Constructors, Ltd.
"In our opinion, there continues to be a real need for improved and advanced education and training in the construction sector and an improved method of attracting and retaining the best and brightest of our future generations. We submit that this program is a significant step in the right direction toward achieving these goals and believe that successful graduates of an effective four-year degree program will help to raise the bar in terms of the knowledge and capabilities of companies involved in the construction industry."
Michael George
, President, Trisura Insurance
"The urgency for a program of this nature is fuelled by the rapid change in our construction industry and the fact that it is becoming more technology-driven each day. Having graduates of such competency enter the industry with refined skills on both the technical and managerial aspects of construction will not only fill a void that currently exists, but bring immeasurable promise to the future of project managers, site superintendents and construction management in general."
Mike Van Volsen
, Operations Manager, Access Suspended Platforms Inc.
Educational Pathways
Graduates of the Honours Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) program qualify to pursue graduate studies in relevant fields of study. They need to directly contact universities to explore what qualified graduate school opportunities exist.

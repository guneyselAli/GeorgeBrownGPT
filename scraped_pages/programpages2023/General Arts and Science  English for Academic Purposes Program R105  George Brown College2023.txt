Certified teachers use a wide range of interactive teaching resources both in-person, in state-of-the-art classrooms and online.
Choose Your Own EAP Pathway
At the start of Level 7 or Level 8, students may choose to*:
continue in the post-secondary stream of the English for Academic Purposes program, or
pursue Level 7 or Level 8 English for Business Studies, or
pursue Level 7 or Level 8 English for Hospitality Studies
*Space is limited and students may not receive their first-choice stream.
In the EAP program, students can also choose to enroll in a series of selective courses. These courses give students the opportunity to develop specific communication skills, critical thinking abilities, digital skills and academic skills that will prepare them for further studies in a college environment.
Note:
Upon completion of Level 8, students interested in developing the higher language skills required for college or university degrees, postgraduate co-op programs or field education can pursue Level 9 studies.

We offer nine levels of EAP that progress from beginner to advanced levels. Each 16-week semester includes two levels.

Classes are held Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. By registering, students are expected to attend the schedule as it is assigned.

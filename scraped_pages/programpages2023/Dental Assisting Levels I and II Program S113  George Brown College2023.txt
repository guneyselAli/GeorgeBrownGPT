Special Requirements
MANDATORY REQUIREMENT FOR S113
Pre-placement Health Form
Upon confirmation of acceptance into this program, students must meet all the mandatory pre-placement health requirements for the program. It may take up to four months to complete all the requirements.
All costs, service fees and fines associated with the overall health requirements are the responsibility of the student.
For further details and to download the mandatory pre-placement health form, go to the
Pre-placement website.
MANDATORY REQUIREMENT FOR S113
Police Vulnerable Sector Check
(must be valid annually)
In compliance with the requirements of our our on-site clinic and our placement partners, all students in this program are required to have a police vulnerable sector check completed, and this check must be renewed annually before entering into field or clinical placement.
The Police Vulnerable Sector Check process typically takes two to three months, but under some circumstances can take four to eight months.
This is required to protect the clientele of our placement partner agencies, who are considered "vulnerable persons" under the law.
Students are responsible for ensuring that the Police Vulnerable Sector Check covers appropriateness for "individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s)."
Students are required to keep the original copy of their Police Vulnerable Sector Check.
Students who are unable to provide a "clear" Police Vulnerable Sector Check may not be able to start their field or clinical placement and therefore may be unable to complete the program. Students who are not eligible to attend their practice placement due to a "not clear" status will jeopardize their progress in the program.
Failure to meet the requirements for field placement will prevent students from completing the program and/or securing employment.The fees for the police record check vary and must be paid by the student. For more information, please visit the
Pre-placement website.
Covid-19 vaccination is highly recommended for oral health care workers and those working with vulnerable populations. Hospitals, long term care facilities and some community agencies continue to require COVID-19 vaccines for placements.
Students who are not vaccinated may not be able to attend external clinical or field placements. As a result, this may pose a risk of meeting the requirements for program completion.
The onsite WAVE (Wellness, Applied Learning, Visionary, Education) dental clinic will not require vaccination but is highly recommended. Use of PPE will be required in all onsite clinics.

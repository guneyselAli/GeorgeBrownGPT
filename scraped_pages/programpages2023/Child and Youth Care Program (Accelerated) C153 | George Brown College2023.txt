Special Requirements
Clinical Pre-placement health form requirements and program policy
Upon confirmation of acceptance into this program, students must meet and complete all the mandatory requisite health form requirements for this program. It will take up to 10 to 12 weeks to complete.
Students will need to process and provide proof of their
medical records
such as (MMR, Varicella, Hep B blood test reports/titers, Tdap shot valid every 10 years and two-step TB skin test), a clear
Police Vulnerable Sector Check
renewed every year,
Standard First Aid certificate
renewed every three years and
CPR level C
renewed every year. These requirements must be submitted by the given deadline to
ParaMed.
Students who do not comply with the program’s health policy and requirements will not be eligible to attend and will be excluded from the field practicum, which may jeopardize your academic standing and ability to graduate in this program.
All costs, service fees and fines associated with the overall health requirements are the responsibility of the student.
To download the mandatory requisite health form, and for more details, go to the
Pre-placement website
.
Police Vulnerable Sector Check requirements and program policy (renew every year)
In compliance with the requirements of our placement partners, all students in this program are required to have a
Police Vulnerable Sector Check
completed, and this check must be renewed annually before entering into field or clinical placement.
The Police Vulnerable Sector Check process typically takes two to three months, but under some circumstances can take four to eight months. This is required to protect the clientele of our placement partner agencies, who are considered “vulnerable persons” under the law.
Students are responsible for ensuring that the Police Vulnerable Sector Check covers appropriateness for “individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s).”
Students are required to keep the original copy of their Police Vulnerable Sector Check.
Students who are unable to provide a “clear” Police Vulnerable Sector Check may not be able to start their field or clinical placement and therefore may be unable to complete the program. Students who are not eligible to attend their practice placement due to a “not clear” status will jeopardize their progress in the program. Our agency partners have the final decision for students being allowed to practice in their agency.
Failure to meet the requirements for field placement will prevent students from completing the program and/or securing employment.
The fees for the police record check vary and must be paid by the student. For more information, please visit the
Pre-placement website
.
Our field placement partners may require students to show proof of vaccination. It is your responsibility to ensure all pre-placement requirements are met.

"After working at Cedar Heights Residential Living for just a few months, I was hired as a case manager. I work with youth living with brain based development issues who often have more than one diagnosis.
There is never a dull day at work but I feel confident in the field due to my experience at GBC. I had a good base to start from because of the dedication of faculty in making course content relevant and I can apply lessons learnt to my actual work.
Thank you once again for everything!"

SSW Pathways to BSW and MSW
George Brown College is a signatory of Colleges and Institutes Canada’s Indigenous Education Protocols, which reaffirms the importance of structures and approaches required to address Indigenous peoples' learning needs and support self-determination and socio-economic development of Indigenous communities.
In response to this and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada’s Calls to Action, the Social Service Worker program is committed to developing the capacity of its students to work with the Indigenous individuals, families, groups and communities. The faculty acknowledge the support of Indigenous Education and Services at George Brown College and Negahneewin Council at Confederation College, who have helped them with this process. The Indigenous Learning Outcomes guide the integration of Indigenous learning into the curriculum.
Your Field Education Options
Field education provides students in George Brown's Social Service Worker program with a significant learning opportunity. In year two, you will have the chance to participate in a
year-long field experience with a community agency for approximately 528 hours.
While in placement, you will be supervised by qualified professional practitioners.
George Brown maintains relationships with agencies operating in a wide range of institutional and community-based settings throughout the Greater Toronto Area and will support you in making connections to secure a placement.
Note:
In compliance with the requirements of our field partners, all students in this program are encouraged to complete a Police Vulnerable Sector Check before commencing their field placement. These reference checks, which can take up to four months, are done to protect the clientele of these agencies who are considered “vulnerable persons” under the law. The fees for the reference checks vary by region and must be paid by the student. Students are responsible for ensuring that the check covers appropriateness for “individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s).”
The SSW program will assist students in applying for the police vulnerable sector check once they begin the program.
Students without a clear Police Vulnerable Sector Check may find that their choice of placement is limited. Students in this situation are encouraged to work with the field education coordinator to identify placement opportunities that do not require the Police Vulnerable Sector Check. Students are also encouraged to inquire and apply for Suppression and Destruction of Record or Record Suspension (formerly known Pardon) at their specific regional police services, in order to prepare for their future career or employment. For more information, please visit the Clinical
Pre-placement website.

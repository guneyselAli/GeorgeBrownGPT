To put it simply, being a George Brown student changed my life. Having graduated from the Dental Office Administration program, I was prepared for situations seen daily in a dental office. I acquired clinical knowledge and through the field placement requirement, my career was launched!
With the specific courses covered, I was taught the fundamentals of administrative dentistry, making me an exceptional candidate for employment.
Most importantly, my time at George Brown College taught me about myself and my passion. I have found a career as a Head Patient Coordinator, an opportunity that arose directly through my field placement!
Knowing I am a valued team member making a difference within my clinic and with our patients is an incredible feeling. There are opportunities for growth within my company and I am excited to see what the future holds.
It all began at George Brown College, and I am proud to be another blossoming Alumni!

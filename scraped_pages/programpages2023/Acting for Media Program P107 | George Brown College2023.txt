Full Description
The
Acting for Media
program goes beyond just acting for film and television and comprises training needed for you to succeed as a screen actor: acting technique, movement, voice and script analysis. You will learn to articulate yourself through screen characterization, on-camera experience and audition etiquette and standards. As a graduate from one of
Canada’s Top 20 Acting Schools
, you will have a solid knowledge base of the industry including its history, structure and hierarchy and professional standards. Workshop simulations, on-camera exercises, voice-over demonstrations, green-screen training and training in motion-capture suits provide you with the skills needed to be a successful actor in the field.
Thanks to technological advancements within the film industry, actors are being called upon to characterize in new and interesting ways. Students will be given a basic understanding of the use of such new technology as phonography and immersive environments.
Student Selection
Enrolment is limited, ensuring adequate personal attention is given to each student. Admission is competitive, based on the results of auditions and questions. A minimum academic standing plus passing grades in acting must be achieved in order to be promoted to the next semester.
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
Actors move across multiple platforms including film, television, interaction storytelling, motion capture for gaming and animation, and voice-over for narration or dubbing.
Potential job titles include:
Actor/Actress
Film Dubber
Voice-over Actor
Narrator
Dramatic Reader
An ever-expanding local film and screen industry creates a consistent demand for fresh faces and new talent in a range of educational, entertainment and commercial activities. Students should be aware, however, that the field is extremely competitive.
Recognized by the
Alliance of Canadian Television and Radio Artists (ACTRA)
, graduates can apply within one year and join ACTRA as an Apprentice member. As a member, you can look for representation and audition as a union member.

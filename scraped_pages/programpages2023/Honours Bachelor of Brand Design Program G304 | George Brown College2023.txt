The

Full Description
The
Honours Bachelor of Brand Design
is a four-year degree program that responds to the rapidly changing world of graphic design by preparing you to be forward-looking brand designers with strengths in collaboration, research, critical and strategic thinking, technical design execution and brand storytelling. It is built on multidisciplinary pillars of research, critical thinking, strategic brand development, technical design execution and brand storytelling.
Brands are more than logos or sales tactics, they are carefully developed relationships between the brand makers and audiences –
a brand is a promise to follow through on a purpose and a set of values that taken together express how someone perceives an organization or product.
The Honours Bachelor of Brand Design degree is an opportunity to build a knowledgeable creative community of collaborators and strategic designers who are able to bridge business strategy, technology and the design world in order to produce innovative brand experiences.
As a student of the Honours Bachelor of Brand Design degree program, you will develop the analytical and technical skills to:
Communicate
and evolve the brand through the design of visual and physical, online and offline identities and experiences.
Research
to create and tailor designs that work across different touchpoints, generating dynamic, responsive, multisensory and personalized brand experiences for customers.
Write,
visualize and translate the brand story across these touchpoints and engage long-term with the emotions of audiences.
Collaborate
toward creative innovation with multidisciplinary teams.
This program responds to the dynamic and growing field of design, training you to:
Create streamlined brand messaging across numerous mediums and touchpoints that engages audiences.
Understand new technology and be able to work across the old and new channels.
Have strong writing skills and adapt to different situations, audiences and genres.
Be flexible in that they are able to adapt to changing work and work environments (multiple sectors, services and products).
Work collaboratively and bridge business and creative roles by understanding the culture, processes and language of the branding business.
Utilize diverse and quantifiable research methodologies in the design process.
Offer a diverse and customizable range of services to clients, particularly niche services (e.g., video and animation).
Have the ability to compete on tender: put together a professional sales pitch while offering a competitive price.

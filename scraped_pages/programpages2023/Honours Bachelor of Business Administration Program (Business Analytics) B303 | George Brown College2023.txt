Why the Bachelor of Business Administration (Business Analytics)?
Businesses have access to an abundance of data, creating opportunities for our graduates throughout high-demand sectors such as banking, government, pharmaceutical, finance, health care and telecommunications. In order for business leaders to make better decisions, they need analysts with a superior ability to interpret data from multiple sources. How do you ensure the appropriate data will be most effective for making optimal decisions? When do you involve human judgment? How do you tell a compelling story from the data? What are some of the most practical applications of current analytics technologies?
In this business analytics degree program, you will learn an applied framework that incorporates business intelligence models, data management, data insights and frameworks, data-science-based decisions and value-creation opportunities to build strong confidence when data is used for increased effectiveness in decision-making. Drawing on global experiences, your professors will prepare you for an analytics role not just in Canada, but in any country on the planet.
Upon completion of the program, you will know the differences between various analytics approaches and be able to identify the most appropriate ones for your situation. More importantly, you'll know how to tackle big data and leverage it for better business decision-making and outcomes.
This program focuses on skills development, technical and otherwise, including analytic understanding and dissemination for various business uses. A bold mix of skills – including some programming using the latest software, applied statistical comprehension and database understanding – will be explored in the context of organizational data requirements.
Delivery
This full-time degree program is delivered in an online format for the first two years and in-person for the latter two years.
International students can study the first two years remotely from their home country and no study permit is required. However, students would have to apply for a study permit well in advance of coming to Canada to begin year three (5th semester). If students are successful in securing a study permit for years 3 and 4 of the program, they will also be eligible to apply for a post-graduation work permit.

Work-integrated learning experiences that amount to no less than 14 weeks of full-time equivalent work (420 hours), either in one block or in multiple cumulative blocks appropriate to achieving the program learning outcomes.

Program Description
Program Overview
With more and more businesses putting their data into the cloud, the ability to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability of digital assets has become paramount to their success and survival. The cyber security professional plays a vital role in the protection of business assets in all areas of our economy. In order to keep pace with the rapid advancement in technology and trends, the cyber security professional of today must be proficient in traditional networking and cloud-based technologies. In addition, they must have a strong familiarity with security trends and practices, the legal landscape and ethical hacking. Strong communication skills round out the skills of today's cyber security professional.
Full Description
The Cyber Security graduate certificate program at George Brown College is designed to meet the high demand for cyber security professionals and related IT security professionals across multiple sectors – including consulting services, finance and health care.
As a student in this program, you will begin with learning the theory and practical skills required to become a cyber security professional. This includes the differences and similarities between cyber security and hacking. You will learn about the primary attack surfaces (physical, social, electronic), methods for compromising the attack surfaces, and how to mitigate vulnerabilities.
In the third semester, you will learn advanced techniques in ethical hacking incident response. A capstone group project will provide you with an opportunity to showcase your skills and talents for potential employers. These skills include:
digital forensics and incident response management
ethical hacking and analyzing malware
delivering security training
applying cryptography
In addition to traditional technical skills, the cyber security professionals of today require many non-technical skills and talents, such as:
analytical skills
written and verbal communication
project and time management skills
interpersonal and conflict management skills
Students graduating from this program are prepared to help defend organizations from the many current and emerging cyber threats, including malware, network attacks and data compromise. They will have the capabilities to monitor, assess and evaluate security risks and threats to physical and digital infrastructure, develop and implement security contingency planning, and lead the development of policies and procedures to ensure the mitigation of security risks.
Delivery
This full-time program is delivered in a blended format, combining face-to-face sessions with online delivery, designed to accommodate those who wish to work while taking the program.
This schedule will require that learners attend classes that generally take place in the late afternoons and evenings through the week, plus all day Saturday.
Technology Requirements
This program requires students to have access to a personal laptop with the following specifications:
8 GB RAM (16 GB recommended)
Support for virtualization
256 GB SSD Hard Drive (500+ GB is optimal)
2 TB (minimum) external hard drive
Webcam + mic
Consistent access to a reliable high-speed internet connection
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
As a result of the increase in cyber security–related attacks, employer demand for cyber security professionals is increasing, and growth is projected to continue. According to World Economic Forum (WEF), Global Risks Report 2022, "There is an undersupply of cyber professionals—a gap of more than three million worldwide—who can provide cyber leadership, test and secure systems, and train people in digital hygiene."
Educational Pathways
Students who successfully complete this program may qualify for entry into Ontario college graduate certificate and university degree programs.

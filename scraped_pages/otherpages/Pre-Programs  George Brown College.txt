Pre-programs offer smaller classrooms and built-in support like Pathway Advisors who can help you plan and achieve your educational goals and explore career choices. You'll be free to explore your options and investigate program streams in order to discover your primary areas of interest and passion.
These programs are a great option if you're still trying to figure out what you want to study or which career path aligns with your goals. They give you time to strengthen your academic skills so that you're prepared for further study. We currently have pre-programs in Business, Community Services and Health Sciences.

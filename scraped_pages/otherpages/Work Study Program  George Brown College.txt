The George Brown College Work Study Program provides students with part-time employment opportunities throughout the college. Students can gain valuable experience working up to 15 hours a week at minimum wage. Students locate their own job with any of the on-campus departments (for example: athletics, academic departments, library, etc.), complete a Work Study Program application form with the employer which will then be submitted to the Financial Assistance Office by the employer. Many of the jobs are posted on the GBCareers website. Students can start work once their Work Study application is approved by the Financial Assistance Office.Â 
For OSAP students: Remember that income earned during the school year from any source, Work Study Program or not, legally must be reported to the Financial Assistance Office and may impact your OSAP funding, either during the current school year or in the future. Applications and information are available through the Financial Assistance Office.

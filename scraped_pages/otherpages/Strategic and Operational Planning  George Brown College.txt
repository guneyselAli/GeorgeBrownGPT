The George Brown College Business Plan 2022-2023 has been designed to showcase the College’s initiatives that will enhance how we serve our community for years to come. Our response to COVID-19 has helped accelerate our existing plans to enhance digitization at George Brown, while turning a spotlight on next-generation methods of teaching and learning.  This plan is set in the context of our values, mindset and impact, the college’s Vision for 2030, and the commitments and priorities articulated in Strategy 2022, acknowledging the pace of change, level of complexity and uncertainty that is part of our environment.

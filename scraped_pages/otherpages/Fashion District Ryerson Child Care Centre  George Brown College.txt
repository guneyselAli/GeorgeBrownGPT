Fashion District Ryerson Child Care Centre opened in the fall of 1990 and is located within Ryerson Public School at Bathurst and Dundas. We offer a kindergarten program that is blended with the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) to provide a seamless day approach to learning. We also offer a before and after School program for children ages 6-10 years.
Our centre serves as a model lab school for the diploma and degree programs in the School of Early Childhood, and provides a training ground where college students are supported in developing their skills in working with children and families as they complete the hands on component of their academic program.

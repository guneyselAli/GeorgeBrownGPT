George Brown College is one of the Top 20 Canadian Acting Schools in 2021 – The Casting Workbook 
George Brown College Theatre Arts students train and perform a season at the beautiful Young Centre for the Performing Arts in Toronto’s Distillery District.
The 44,000 square-foot facility serves as a performance, training and outreach centre nestled in the historic area on the east side of Toronto’s downtown core. We share this facility with Soulpepper Theatre - a renowned classical repertory company. Other companies rent this space, meaning our students often get to mingle and interact with working professionals.
Theatre Arts students perform a season at the Young Centre for the Performing Arts in their third and final year, working alongside guest directors and professional theatre technicians.

At George Brown College, our awards program provides financial support to eligible students in need. This financial support comes in the form of scholarships, awards and bursaries and looks at criteria like academic achievement, financial need, and community involvement.
Did you know?You only need to fill out your student profile (basic information, budget and essays) once per academic year to be considered for several awards, such as College-Wide and Divisional awards. You can re-use the same student profile, however, you are required to re-submit the College-Wide awards application and Divisional awards application each term to be considered. Talk about a time-saver!
There are many awards to choose from, so we encourage you to have a look at the different types to see which one(s) you may be eligible for.Â 
Check out our step-by-step guide for applying for scholarships, awards, and bursaries.

Awards, Scholarships and bursaries are considered part of a student's taxable income for the year. The College will issue a T4A form to all recipients who received an award. The T4A is issued in late February for awards, scholarships or bursaries received in the previous calendar year. You can access your T4A on https://stuview.georgebrown.ca/.

Program Review Process Infographic
George Brown College is committed to continuous quality improvement and ongoing academic self-assessment and evaluation. The annual and comprehensive academic program review processes and reports provide academic leaders with critical information about a program’s strengths, challenges, overall quality and need for future resources.
The program review process is led by a program reviewer who works with the faculty team to complete the various required components. In addition, a curriculum specialist might work with the team if curriculum-related activities are needed or recommended.
A comprehensive review takes place every five to seven years. While the Office of Academic Excellence will manage a rolling three-year plan, deans will assist with determining the timetable for reviews so strategic priorities, mandated accreditations and other program-specific data can be considered in the timeline. A program reviewer is assigned to complete the comprehensive review, which involves, among other things:
The comprehensive review of degree programs happens approximately every five years to align with the ministry schedule for degree consent renewal.

In certain circumstances, a program will be required to complete a program quality self-assessment (PQSA) instead of a comprehensive program review. This could be the case if a program has a shorter duration, has lower enrolment or if performance metrics indicate the program isn’t experiencing major difficulties.
With guidance and assistance from the Office of Academic Excellence, the PQSA report will be written by program staff, including faculty, coordinators and program administrators and submitted to their academic manager by April 30 of the academic review year. A copy of the PQSA report, including recommendations, will be forwarded to the Office of Academic Excellence as well as to the appropriate dean by June 15 of the academic review year.
Program Quality Self-Assessment Overview
Academic managers are responsible for conducting an annual review of the programs in their portfolios to ensure stakeholders are engaged in continuous quality assurance. An annual program review is designed to ensure the program is responding to the needs of industry and students, so it remains relevant and up to date.
Annual Program Review Overview
Academic managers work with program staff to ensure the annual review documentation is completed and sent to their deans by June 15 of the academic review year. Then they ensure any new recommendations are added to the program review recommendations spreadsheet, which is updated annually and forwarded to the Office of Academic Excellence by June 30 of the academic review year.

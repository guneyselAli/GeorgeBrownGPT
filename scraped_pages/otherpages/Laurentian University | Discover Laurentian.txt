In direct response to the 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action, the Truth and Reconciliation Task Force (TRTF) was established in the fall of 2018, and in 2021, the Truth and Reconciliation Task Force Implementation Committee (TRTF-IC) was established to oversee the fulfillment of the Task Force’s recommendations.
The Truth and Reconciliation Report Card was collectively determined on September 30th, 2021 to assess and transparently communicate our progress on these recommendations.

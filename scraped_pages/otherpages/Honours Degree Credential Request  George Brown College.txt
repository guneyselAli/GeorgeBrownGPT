George Brown College has received permission from the Ministry of Colleges and Universities to amend the official nomenclature of our degrees to include Honours in the degree title.
The MCU had decided that the new degree title is better aligned with other degree titles in their respective fields and is a more accurate reflection of the nature of the program of study.
To receive a new credential you must return your degree, in person to any of our Student Services areas, or by mail to the following address with the completed Credential Request form:

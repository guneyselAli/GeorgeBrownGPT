George Brown College has adopted the MyCreds platform for digital badging and micro-credentials. 
"At George Brown, we seek to empower lifelong learners," says Janene Christiansen, Registrar and Associate Vice-President Strategic Enrolment, George Brown College. "Our new partnership with MyCreds™ will provide a seamless and secure badging experience for our micro-credential students as they embark on the next stage of their learning and career development." 
MyCreds™ is a national, shared service and platform that provides students and graduates access to a secure, online, password protected learner credential wallet. This virtual wallet allows them to view and share their academic documents in a digitized format on a 24/7 basis — anytime, anywhere. It also enables sharing between organizations with the learner’s permission. Secure, cryptographically signed documents can be sent conveniently and require no further verification. MyCreds™ is the first and only national bilingual system of its kind in Canada.

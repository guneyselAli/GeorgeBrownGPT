How does our company become a preferred vendor to the college?
GBC does not have a preferred vendors list for any commodity or service. We have Vendors of records for Architects, General Contractors, Search Firms and Consultants. These VOR’s are renewed every so often. All other requirements are tendered on an as-needed basis.
Can we respond to tenders in any other format than through Bonfire?
No. GBC is using Bonfire exclusively for all tender bids, either open or by invitation.

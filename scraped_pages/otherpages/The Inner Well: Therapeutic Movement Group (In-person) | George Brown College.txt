This group is designed to create a space for students to reconnect with themselves, learn body-based skills to reduce stress, become more aware of their own emotions and body wisdom to understand themselves better and cultivate self-compassion.
The group uses therapeutic dance, mindful movement and music in a supportive non-judgemental community where every student is welcome to show up and be as they are. No prior movement experience is needed to participate.
It’s important to be able to attend all sessions.

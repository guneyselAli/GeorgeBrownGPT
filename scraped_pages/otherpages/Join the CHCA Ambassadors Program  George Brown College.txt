The Centre for Hospitality and Culinary Arts Ambassador Program is a volunteer program where you have the opportunity to help your college community at events dedicated to both industry and students! These events provide you with the chance to connect with fellow classmates and network with industry professionals! 
Throughout the semester, CHCA provides the Ambassadors with a wide variety of events in which they are encouraged to volunteer for and gain valuable hands-on experience. Each event ambassadors volunteer for will result in one point, which will enter you into a monthly draw. The more events you volunteer for, the more points you have towards the monthly draws! Students must participate in minimum one (1) volunteer opportunity per semester to be eligible for rewards during that semester. 
This program is eligible for student’s enrolled in a full-time program at the Centre for Hospitality and Culinary Arts.

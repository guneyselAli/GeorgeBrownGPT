 If you require child care services in order to attend school, we recommend looking into child care centres staffed by our own fully trained early childhood educators. GBC has collaborations with 12 innovative child care centres across Toronto, including ones close to the Casa Loma and St. James campuses. Most offer priority to GBC students and staff. Visit each centre's page to learn more about admissions.

George Brown College is committed to creating a viable bicycle culture. By working together we can promote a culture in which bicycles, pedestrians, and motor vehicles can travel safely and securely.
Bikes can be extremely valuable, and are among the most frequently stolen items off the streets of Toronto. Many bikes are left unlocked or are secured with a poor quality lock.
If you choose to cycle to George Brown College please secure your bike with a good lock to one of the bicycle lock stands provided on our campuses. Â 
George Brown College in partnership with the Toronto Police Services recommends that any one riding a bicycle, should register their bicycle with the police at: www.torontopolice.on.ca/bike/.
The Toronto Police Services also has a great bicycle safety pamphlet available at:www.torontopolice.on.ca/bike/registrationform.pdf.

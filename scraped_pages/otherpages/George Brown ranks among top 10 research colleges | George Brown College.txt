George Brown is once again ranked in the top 10 for Canadian colleges when it comes to research activities.  
RESEARCH Infosource Inc. releases a yearly ranking of the top Canadian research institutions. For 2022, George Brown College ranked ninth in overall research income among colleges. We also ranked third for the number of completed projects and in the top 10 for paid student researchers and industry research income.  
“We are so pleased to once again rank in the top 10, but the real story is the journey of our student researchers,” says Dr. Krista Holmes, Associate Vice-President of Research & Innovation. “Every student that works on a project learns the language of innovation, and they’ll bring that mindset into every job they have in the future. We’ll continue to invest in valuable opportunities for researchers, students and graduates that enable industry and community innovation.” 
With 143 active projects last year, we provided students with almost 1,000 experiential learning opportunities. On our projects, students apply what they learn in the classroom to real-world problems while also forging meaningful connections with industry for their life beyond graduation. 
George Brown College also recently won a $4.5 million Mitacs Accelerate Umbrella award for student research internships.

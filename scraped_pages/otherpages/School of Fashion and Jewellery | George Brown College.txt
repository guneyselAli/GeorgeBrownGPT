Ranked among the top 100 in the world in 2020 by CEO World magazine, and considered one of the top fashion schools in Canada, our programs will equip you with essential knowledge and skills to excel in the Canadian fashion industry.
We’re located in downtown Toronto, Canada’s fashion capital, which means you’ll have access to this exciting industry while you study. Through instructors with insider know-how, state-of-the-art equipment, and field education, we provide industry-ready training. We’ll expose you to high-profile guest lecturers and networking events, giving you a good insight into the industry that you want to work in.

We cover the entire spectrum of fashion design and fashion business education from technology to the fundamentals of design, marketing, merchandising, manufacturing and fashion management.
Creativity and attention to detail are only some of the skills needed to succeed in the jewellery industry or as an independent artist. George Brown College can help you develop the rest.

Find out how to apply for OSAP . You are encouraged to apply for OSAP early to ensure that there is ample time to process your application.

The initial deposit is a minimum requirement for you to register, confirming your attendance to your program and to create your timetable. It is the student's responsibility to cover this deposit, as they must be registered in order to receive OSAP funding.

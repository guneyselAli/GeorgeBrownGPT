Michael Gerstein Fingold's kind and jovial nature left a mark on all who knew him throughout his life. Sadly, the world lost Michael on April 2, 2021.
Michael loved everything about food. From a very early age, Michael discovered his passion for food, eating at the best restaurants and later, turned this passion into his vocation, becoming a personal chef. He gained great pleasure in cooking for others.
The connections Michael made throughout his life were continuously reinforced over great meals, discussions about restaurants and, a love for food. As such, Michael’s beloved children Cole and Mimi Fingold have chosen to honour his legacy through the creation of the Michael Fingold Culinary School Scholarship at George Brown College’s Centre for Hospitality and Culinary Arts. This scholarship will support culinary students facing obstacles to their education including financial barriers and who exhibit the passionate, warm and generous energy for which Michael was so well known.
Donations to the Michael Fingold Culinary School Scholarship will elicit a tax receipt for the full amount. 100% of your donation will directly go to support the scholarship.

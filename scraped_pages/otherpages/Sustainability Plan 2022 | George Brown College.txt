As a college, we recognize that we need to reimagine how we manage our shared global environment and natural resources. We have a responsibility to reduce our eco-footprint and to have a positive contribution to climate change through initiatives such as a sustainability-driven procurement process, energy retrofits and conservation practices, and zero waste strategies.
One of the strategic commitments in George Brown College’s Vision 2030 is that sustainability should be key to the success of the college with the goal that we demonstrate “behaviours, actions and policies that lead to environmental, financial and social sustainability".
Our Sustainability Plan 2022 is built around three overarching and aligned goals. These goals encompass a range of activities that will be pursued in order to achieve sustainability progress.

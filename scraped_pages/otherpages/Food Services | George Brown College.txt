 If you want to grab a quick coffee and a snack before heading into class or you’re looking for meal options, we’ve got you covered at each campus. And if you’re bringing food from home, you can find microwaves in your campus cafeteria and Student Association (SA) areas. More options are available at the St. James Campus, where you can find the GBC Café, Chef on the Run and The Chefs’ House, all of which feature student-made foods.
We even have exclusive options for eating well at home through our Good Food Market (Thursdays during semesters, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at 200 King Street East) and the Student Association’s Student Nutrition Access Program.

We are very proud to be named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers for 2022 — the sixth straight year we’ve made the list. 
The Greater Toronto’s Top Employers 2022 report was published in the Globe and Mail on December 3. It highlights the reasons George Brown was once again chosen as a top employer, which include: 
Employers are selected based on eight criteria including physical workplace; work atmosphere; health, financial, and family benefits; vacation and time off; employee communications; performance management; training and skills development; and community involvement. 
We’ve adapted to the evolving needs of employees, including launching the Return to Campus plan and the Future of Work initiative that lays out how our organization will transition to hybrid working.  
To further support employees’ well-being and work/life balance, we extended the Employee and Family Assistance plan to all employees. We also initiated Meeting-Free Fridays and employee wellness days (extra days off added to long weekend and holiday break) and continue to offer early leave on Fridays before long weekends.

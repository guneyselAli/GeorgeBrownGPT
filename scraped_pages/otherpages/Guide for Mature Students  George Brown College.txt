Perhaps you went to college or university several years ago but want to upgrade your skills or change careers. Or you took some time away from school to raise a family and now that the kids are all grown up, you're ready to get back to it.
Whatever your reasons for going back to a life of learning, you may find yourself in a very different educational environment. The post-secondary education system has changed over the years due to increasing demands of employers, growing competition in the workforce and shifting expectations of students.
The best place to begin is the Ontario College Application Services (OCAS) website at www.ontariocolleges.ca where you will find information on colleges, programs and courses, the application process, important dates, financial assistance and lots more.
Also take a look at the websites of the colleges you are interested in applying to for more specific information. Visit our web site to find information about Programs and Courses at George Brown College.
There is no right or wrong way to go about choosing a college because everyone's choices will be based on different goals and interests. Here are some questions to consider when choosing a college:
Because you'll be going to school almost every day, you don't want to waste too much time or money just getting there so location is a key consideration. George Brown's three campuses are all within walking distance of the TTC - talk about great location!

Co-op placements, internships and work terms are the best way for you to really see what working in a particular field is like and make important contacts with employers. Look for colleges that have built strong partnerships with reputable companies and employers in different sectors of the workforce.

Sometimes who you know is just as important as what you know. Colleges that are well connected to different sectors and industries will be able to provide more networking opportunities like company tours, guest speakers, and events that allow you to meet potential employers and industry influencers. On the George Brown College website, each program area lists its industry partners so students can see the kinds of connections they will benefit from.

No doubt about it, post-secondary education is expensive. Thankfully, there are a number of sources that can help you pay for college. For starters:
You may receive OSAP funding in the form of loans (money you pay back) and grants (money you donâ€™t have to pay back) if the college you are attending is approved for student loan purposes and you are taking at least 60 per cent of a full-time program (40 per cent if you have a disability).OSAP recommends that you apply as early as possible to allow sufficient processing time.
Online process:
If you are approved, you'll get a portion of your loan at the beginning of your study period and the rest about halfway through.
Here are some other things to consider with OSAP:
Several banks have products that are tailor-made for people enrolled in post-secondary education. This option is worth investigating because interest rates and payback periods will vary from OSAP loans.
Support in the form of scholarships, awards and bursaries are awarded to eligible students based on criteria including and not limited to academic achievement, financial need, and community involvement. The criteria varies based on the award and can be viewed under the types of awards page.

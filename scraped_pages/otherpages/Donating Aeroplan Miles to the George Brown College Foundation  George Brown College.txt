George Brown College Foundation has partnered with Aeroplan's Beyond Miles Participating Charities, which will enable the Foundation to accept donations of Aeroplan® Miles and convert those miles into funds.
In addition, with this new partnership, families and friends of students are able to donate and convert Aeroplan® Miles into funds to cover their fees at the College.
Cindy Gouveia, Chief Development Officer at the Foundation is enthusiastic about this new way to give back to George Brown. "We're excited as this will increase access for students who have faced financial barriers to entry into our institution. This will also provide our existing and new donors with an alternate method to give back to the College. Our fundraising efforts just got a major boost, because students and potential donors have an additional source of potential funding, especially in cases where giving cash may not be an option for a donor."
When you donate your Aeroplan Miles to the George Brown College Foundation through Beyond Miles, your loyalty program points are converted into funds that support student scholarships, bursaries and capital expansion projects.
You can head over to our donation page on the Aeroplan website to make your donation!

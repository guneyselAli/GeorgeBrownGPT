You won’t just get a degree at George Brown College, you’ll be mentored by some of the industry’s best chefs. This will help you develop your technical skills, creativity and signature flair as a chef.
George Brown Chef School students are recognized by the industry as some of the best, and George Brown is perceived by GTA-based employers as the GTA college that produces the highest quality graduates with the skills they value most.(Northstar Research, GBC Employer Tracking Research, February 2011) 
Our industry partners work with us to make sure that our chef training programs are current and cutting edge, and that our students get insights and education not found in textbooks. Our Program Advisory Committees (PAC) ensure our curriculum is forward thinking, so students are job-ready.
Whether in the classroom, during special lectures, on-site visits or through field placement externships, you will get to meet, learn from and be inspired by some of the most exciting chefs cooking today. Our 14-week externships will prepare you for fast-paced work environments by giving you hands-on training in the city’s best restaurants and hotels.
Our industry partnerships also extend beyond Toronto. You can choose to complete a study placement abroad. We are connected to these world-renowned schools:

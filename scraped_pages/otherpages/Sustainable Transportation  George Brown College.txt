As part of the Green Team’s efforts to reduce the College’s transportation carbon footprint, we want to actively support energy efficient modes of transportation such as public transit, bicycle commuting, walking, and carpooling.
The following resources will inform you of ways to choose a more sustainable mode of transportation that is healthier and better for the planet. -- It also offers you a chance to save time and money, while reducing stress, traffic congestion and pollution.
For more information about any of these sustainable transportation initiatives, contact: Stephanie Foster
Give your car the day off by walking or cycling to campus with the Activate Your Commute Walking and Cycling program. Track your walking and cycling and see how you can reduce your carbon footprint and other environmental impacts. 
To help you plan your bicycle trip, take advantage of the following resources:

The TTC is encouraging customers to make cycling a part of their transit journey:

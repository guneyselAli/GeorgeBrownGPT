Giving Tuesday, the global day of philanthropy, takes place on November 28, 2023, the Tuesday after Black Friday and Cyber Monday. After two big days of spending, Giving Tuesday is an amazing opportunity for people to band together and donate to important causes. The George Brown College Foundation is proud to participate in this global movement again this year.
On November 28th, we hope you will support George Brown College and double your impact by supporting the Anne Sado Bridging to Opportunity Endowment. This scholarship supports students who are enrolled in bridging programs across George Brown College. Bridging programs allow post-secondary students with prior experience to be recognized in their pursuit of further education. Your generosity can make a positive, tangible impact on their education, so please consider making a donation this Giving Tuesday. 100% of your donation will go to George Brown College students, no processing fees or administration fees will be applied to your gift. You will receive a tax receipt by email for donations made over $20.

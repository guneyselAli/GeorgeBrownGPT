The SafeWalk Program is a joint initiative between the Student Association and George Brown College. SafeWalkers work in pairs to escort George Brown College students, staff and guests to local parking lots, TTC stops or other building on campus. All SafeWalkers are students who have been trained in Emergency First Aid.
The SafeWalk service is available Monday to Friday, from the first day of school in September through to the last day of school in April, with the exception of Winter Break and other days the College is closed.

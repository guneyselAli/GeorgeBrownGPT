Our partners have access to new technologies, state-of-the-art equipment and facilities and tap into our college-wide expertise, for a fraction of the cost of an in-house R&D department. We work with a deep pool of cross-college expertise, recruiting our faculty and students in key investigative roles. This means our partners tap into a range of research capabilities and resources to solve research challenges, from prototyping to branding to everything in between.

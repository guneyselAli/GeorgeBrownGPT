An apprentice is someone who learns a skilled trade on the job under the direction of a certified tradesperson. Apprentices also attend 'in-school’ training for two or three sessions, alternating with work.
Becoming an apprentice can be an important first step to learning new skills and building a rewarding career. There are many careers to choose from (see the list below). One of the benefits of an apprenticeship is you can earn while you learn.
You must be employed in a trade to enter an apprenticeship program at George Brown College. There are a number of post-secondary programs at the college that will help prepare you to become employed as an apprentice.
To become an apprentice, you and your employer must register a Contract of Apprenticeship with the Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development (MLITSD). Approximately one year after registering with MLITSD they will send you an Offer of Training to attend the basic level of the in-school component of your apprenticeship. Only then can you attend an apprenticeship program at George Brown College.
The Toronto regional apprenticeship office phone number for the MLITSD is (416) 326-5800.

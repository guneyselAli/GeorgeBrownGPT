Malware is short for malicious software. It's used by hackers to block access to computer networks and files causing major disruptions and potential data breaches. 
Update your operating system when new versions are released and regularly back up your files. Remain vigilant against cyber security threats or fraud and stay alert for phishing emails by individuals asking for sensitive information, such as passwords or financial account information.
It's an attempt to get your sensitive information. Criminals do this by pretending to be a legitimate sender like a government organization, a phone provider, online stores or people you know.
Phishing comes in many forms, including through email, text messages and through fake websites. 
Examine hyperlinks and attachments: Hover over a link on a desktop or hold it for several seconds on a mobile device to preview the true destination of a link. If the link and/or attachment is suspicious don't click or download.
Keep your passwords private: There isn't any source that would require you provide your credentials to get the latest information. No reputable company will ask for your password over email.
Think twice: Attackers will use emotional appeals in their emails. Stay calm and look closely at the email content before responding. Report suspicious emails to your security.

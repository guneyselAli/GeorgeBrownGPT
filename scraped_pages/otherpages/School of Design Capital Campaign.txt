George Brown College's School of Design is moving to an exciting new facility at the Daniels Waterfront - City of the Arts development, East Bayfront, Toronto. Set to open in 2019, the new facility will provide 103,000 square feet of space for hands-on learning and collaboration activities by students and industry partners. 
The new School of Design will also house the Interdisciplinary Design Studio, the Institute without Boundaries, as well as the Innovation Exchange - a research hub where students and businesses will team up to bring new concepts to market. Both the new facility and the programming it will offer are designed to meet workforce demand by providing specialized, industry-identified skills training. 
We’re raising funds to bring this capital project to completion. Your donation will go towards the completion of this capital project and to supporting the designers of the future. As such, we’re offering a variety of giving options that will allow you to support the project and establish your legacy at the new School of Design:  
Name a space at the new School of Design and create a legacy for yourself or in honour of someone in perpetuity. There still are high-profile naming opportunities available.  
The new School of Design will house a centrally-located, beautifully-designed donor wall comprising of metal plaques of varying sizes. We are offering the chance to name a limited number of metal plaques on this impressive, high-visibility structure.

Make sure taps are completely turned off. After finishing your business with the tap, make sure to completely close it and not let it leak. A leaky tap at one drip per second can waste more than 25 litres of water a day. That's about 10 000 litres per year!
 
Support the Conservation Community: We can all make efforts individually to lead environmentally friendly lifestyles. Environmental groups can organize their members to take action and have a larger voice due to combined efforts. Find a group that works on an issue that motivates you and get involved, whether it's donating your time to plant trees or clean-up litter, writing letters to government officials or just making a donation.

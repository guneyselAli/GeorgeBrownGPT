The Anti-Racism and Equity Advisory (AREA) Committee provides advice to the OAREHRS on anti-racism practices and processes and cultural diversity throughout the college. The purpose of the Advisory Committee is to provide a breadth of knowledge and expertise related to anti-racism and cultural diversity that will support the OAREHRS to meet its mandate, both inside and outside the classroom. The AREA Committee identifies systemic issues related to anti-racism and cultural diversity in the college community; provides feedback on the impact of college policies and programs in relation to these matters, and ensures engagement with key stakeholder communities. Feedback and recommendations from the committee will be shared with the President of the college through quarterly meetings.
The Anti-Racism and Equity Advisory Committee (AREA) was established September 2020 based on recommendation number 5 of the Review of George Brown College Truth and Reconciliation and Anti-Racism/Diversity Report of 2019 - [To] Establish a GBC-wide Anti-Racism, Equity and Diversity Council with involvement of faculty, students and staff supported by the Office and with direct reporting to the GBC Board of Governors.

Women’s Health in Women’s Hands counselling services employs a feminist, woman-centred approach to provide short-term counselling, group sessions and workshops to women from our priority populations. Counselling takes place from the perspective that, throughout history, women have possessed the strengths that have enabled them to cope with adverse situations. Therefore, the approach to counselling focuses on women’s strengths, capabilities, and resources rather than on weaknesses and limitations.
Work is based on mental health promotion rather than on treatment of disorders and/or illnesses. Counselling acknowledges women’s experiences of oppression within the context of power dynamics involving gender, race, class, ability, age and sexual orientation. Mental Health Promotion initiatives aim at offering services that will enhance and strengthen women’s capacity to: implement changes in their social and physical environment, develop a significant social support system, form constructive relationships with others, and gain more control over their own lives.

In this section you will find some information about George Brown College Security staff, Campus Security Desk locations, and Community and Campus Safety and Security Tips.
Some of the qualifications our security staff have include: Ministry-approved Security guard licenses, Use of Force (including handcuffing and baton), first aid/CPR, WHMIS, Smart Serve, conflict de-escalation, positive space training, and dispatch training. Guards also possess other qualifications they chose to personally pursue. The Site Supervisors have Basic Emergency Management. The reason for this is that when an incident happens, they are the incident commander and have to have a basic understanding. In addition, all Supervisors have leadership training.
To locate or contact the main Security Desk for your campus, check out Contact and Security Locations page.

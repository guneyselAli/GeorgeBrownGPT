Inspire your imagination, come and find your story
Are you fascinated by architecture and want to put your creative skills to work? Our programs will teach you the theory and technical skills needed to design and form the built environment around you.
You’ll study at a campus in the heart of Toronto – a major hub of architectural activity. You’ll have the opportunity to engage in experiential learning, become familiar with green building practices and participate in challenging design projects.
Our instructors are experts in their field with strong connections to the industry. They teach using the latest technology including our Building Information Modeling (BIM) studio. With its three floor-to-ceiling screens and the ability to display content from multiple sources, you’ll be immersed in the designs you create as you develop the skills employers want.
Our Entry Advising service is a free service provided by the college to help match your skills, background and career goals with program options.
Attend an information session to learn more about our programs and have your questions answered by our knowledgeable faculty and staff. 
Our tour guides will show you around our classrooms, labs and facilities, and give you an idea of what to expect from student life at George Brown.

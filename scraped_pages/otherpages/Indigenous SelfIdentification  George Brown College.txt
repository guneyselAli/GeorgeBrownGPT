Indigenous students at George Brown College are invited to self-identify so they can access our services.
Whether you’re a member of a First Nations, Métis or Inuit community (status or non-status), you’re welcome to join us.
Self-identification is voluntary, easy and confidential. To self-identify, fill out our form and a member of our team will follow up with you directly.
These resources are limited and are meant to support Indigenous students. If you aren't sure if you are Indigenous, come talk with us and we would be happy to help point you to resources that could help you.
“Come and learn about your heritage, whether you’ve been involved in your community or would like to learn more about your culture.” - Bob Whiteduck Crawford, Indigenous counsellor
“I’ve been using the services since I got to George Brown College and the team is really helpful. Ed and Bob have been super helpful this whole year, assisting with sponsorships and bursaries and just any other questions I have.” - Douglas Tynes, First year George Brown College student, Fashion Management program

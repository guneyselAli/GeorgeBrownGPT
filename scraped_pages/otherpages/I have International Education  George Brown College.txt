It is recommended that you start the credential assessment process as early as possible as it can take time to complete your application and receive the assessment.  Please give yourself 2-3 months prior to the transfer credit application deadline to obtain an assessment.
Education verification from educational institutions in China may be delayed due to a disruption of service.  If you completed education in China and are considering applying for transfer credits in Spring or Fall, it is recommended that you begin the education evaluation process early.  For more, see notice on the CHESICC site.
Please Note:  Credential evaluations that have been obtained for Citizenship and Immigration Canada are not accepted for transfer credit applications.
A course outline must be attached to your application for each course you wish to have assessed as equivalent to a George Brown course.  If the outline is not in English, it must be accompanied with an official translation.
If you are not able to obtain a course outline, you can consider receiving credit through  Prior Learning and Assessment Recognition (PLAR).
All applications for transfer credit must be submitted through Stu-view.

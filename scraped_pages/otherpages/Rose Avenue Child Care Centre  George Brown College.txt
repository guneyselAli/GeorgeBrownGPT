Operated by George Brown College since 2008 and it is located in the heart of St. James Town. The purpose is to support families that live in the community, including those who require before and after school care. Rose Avenue also offers George Brown College ECE students an opportunity to work with school age children within a Toronto District School Board location.
Our centre serves as a model lab school for the diploma and degree programs in the School of Early Childhood, and provides a training ground where college students are supported in developing their skills in working with children and families as they complete the hands on component of their academic program.

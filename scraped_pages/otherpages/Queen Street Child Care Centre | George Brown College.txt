Located within the Centre For Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Queen St. Child Care opened in February 1989 in partnership with CAMH to provide workplace child care for CAMH employees.
Our centre serves as a model lab school for the diploma and degree programs in the School of Early Childhood, and provides a training ground where college students are supported in developing their skills in working with children and families as they complete the hands on component of their academic program.

Are you looking for affordable dental services? Need some new dentures, a new filling or want to get your teeth examined and cleaned?
Students from our School of Dental Health work with our faculty to provide dental services to the public in our WAVE Dental Clinic. By visiting our clinic you'll provide a learning opportunity for one of our students and get professional services at the same time!
Students from our Dental Hygiene, Dental Assisting, Denturism, and Restorative Dental Hygiene programs work with clients in our newly renovated WAVE Dental Clinic to provide low-cost dental care.

The Ontario College Council of Chief Information Officers (OCCCIO) was established to further the strategic and operational goals and objectives of Chief Information Officers and other IT leaders of each member institution. The mission of the OCCCIO is to enhance its members’ ability to lead information technology support strategically and effectively for Ontario Colleges. The OCCCIO hosts an annual spring conference focused on the needs of provincial college IT leaders and staff.
This conference presents an excellent opportunity for companies who do business with colleges to network with Ontario College IT decision-makers and practitioners. The OCCCIO 2022 Conference is hosted by George Brown College in Toronto Ontario. Monday June 6 – Wednesday June 8, 2022.

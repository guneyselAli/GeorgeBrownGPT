The ability to engage in inclusive and racially responsive conversations is a journey that requires cultural self-understanding, addressing our biases and fears, and understanding our power and privilege.
Remember: polarizing and racially-charged topics may not always be front and centre in the workplace, however, it is important to be ready for conversations about these issues when they arise. Start from an authentic place, learn from your mistakes, and commit to continuing to contribute toward a more inclusive learning and working environment here at GBC.

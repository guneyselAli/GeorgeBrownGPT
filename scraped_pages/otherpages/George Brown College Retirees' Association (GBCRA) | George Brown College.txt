Thinking about retirement? The George Brown College Retirees' Association (GBCRA) offers social activities, support and information for new retirees. 
Many new retirees want to learn about the transition to retirement by speaking with someone who has already experienced the process, and we are here to help. So, give us a shout and benefit from our experiences.  
Created in 2014, the GBCRA is a volunteer-run association that aims to reconnect fellow retirees and colleagues through various social and recreational events, learning opportunities, clubs and excursions. By liaising with George Brown College and other retiree associations, the GBCRA can advocate and respond to retiree concerns and provide pertinent information for the benefit of the membership. 
In addition to social events, the association membership is active in various initiatives that support students and give back to the college. A great example is our annual silent auction to fundraise for The Retirees' Association Scholarship Fund and provide an annual bursary for students.   
The GBCRA publishes a regular e-newsletter, is home to a book club and a bridge club, and it offers a range of presentations and other social events. 
For more information about the GBCRA and how to become a member, please email us at info@gbcra.ca, or visit our website at gbcra.org.

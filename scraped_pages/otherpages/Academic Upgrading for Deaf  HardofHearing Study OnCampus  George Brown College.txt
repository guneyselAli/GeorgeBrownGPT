This program is for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing students who want to upgrade their English, American Sign Language (ASL) and Math, and helps increase your chances to be accepted to college and apprenticeship programs, or to find a job. Many of our students go on to successfully attend programs at George Brown and other colleges.
George Brown Deaf upgrading courses are offered at different levels, right up to ACE (Academic and Career Entrance). ACE credits are recognized by Ontario colleges for admission to college and apprenticeship programs. Many employers recognize the ACE certificate as equal to a high school diploma.
To apply, contactÂ deafupgrading@georgebrown.ca.
If you are age 19 or older, are Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing, use ASL and live in Ontario, you can apply.
Deaf Academic Upgrading is tuition-free for Ontario residents age 19 or older. It is funded by Employment Ontario. Eligible students can apply for transportation subsidies.

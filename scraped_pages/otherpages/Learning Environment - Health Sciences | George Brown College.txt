In addition to classroom instruction, students at the School of Dental Health work in the George Brown College dental clinic. The school provides a unique opportunity to work alongside practicing dental professionals; students provide direct client care while learning. There are also field placements at clinics and dental offices throughout the Greater Toronto Area, giving students hands-on experience in providing dental services to real patients.
The learning environments associated with the School of Health and Wellness are as diverse as the program choices and offer hands-on learning in real world work settings. For example, students studying orthotics and prosthetics work in a specialized lab environment based out of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Fitness and lifestyle students get the opportunity to work in fitness centres, interacting with clients, teaching classes and conducting assessments. Students in the hearing instruments specialist program conduct hearing assessments in real clinical environments.
Within any modern health services environment, information is critical. Students at the School of Health Services Management have field placements in clinical settings including private practices, hospitals, and agencies. They work with health information specialists on real client records (both electronic and paper), applying their academic learning about privacy and medical terminology in a practical, clinical setting.
The Sally Horsfall Eaton School of Nursing offers certificate, diploma and degree programs that can lead you into teaching, research, health care administration, and even sales. You will study in our state-of-the-art Daphne Cockwell Centre for Health Sciences at the Waterfront Campus and will learn the required skills from faculty members who are actively involved in the health care field.Â

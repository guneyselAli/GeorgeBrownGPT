George Brown College requires all international students who are travelling from outside Canada to download the iCENT app.
Questions or trouble logging in? Contact support@iCentapp.com. 
If you’re unable to download the app you can log in from the iCent App website.
Google Android in China: We are aware that there have been some download issues for iCent in China. If you are in China, download the app directly.  
Within the iCent app, you will be required to review all the terms and conditions, including submitting all the mandatory forms such as a quarantine plan, attestation form, and emergency contact. 
As part of the George Brown College’s readiness plan, students who are quarantining for 14 days within Canada are now required to check in daily using the iCent app. Students who fail to check in daily, will be contacted by the college. Those who fail to stay in communication may be reported to the public health authorities and/or removed from their academic program of study.

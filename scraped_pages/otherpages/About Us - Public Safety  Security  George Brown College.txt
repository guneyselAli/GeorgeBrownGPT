The George Brown College Public Safety and Security Division is made up of qualified security professionals who are on duty 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to monitor and patrol over 1.9 million square feet of college buildings. Surveillance cameras assist with security and safety oversight and are located throughout the premises. All Security guards are trained in Emergency First Aid/ CPR and receive numerous other training, for example in Mental Health First Aid, Positive Space, and undergo regular scenario training. Security guards respond when there is an immediate threat and are trained to de-escalate conflict situations.
The Public Safety and Security Coordinators respond with confidentiality and professionalism to all sensitive investigations. They are licensed Private Investigators and conduct thorough investigations, manage risk, and monitor developments in cases. Coordinators are certified in Emergency Management, Threat Assessment, and Incident Management, and possess numerous other qualifications specific to each Coordinator.
Since George Brown College is a multi-campus college located in Canada's largest city; we work closely with the Toronto Police Services, the Ontario Provincial Police and all emergency services within the City of Toronto. This strong relationship enhances our ability to focus on providing a safe and secure learning and work environment for the entire George Brown College community.

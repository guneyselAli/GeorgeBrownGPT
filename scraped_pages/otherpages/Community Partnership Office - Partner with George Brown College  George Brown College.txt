The Community Partnerships Office (CPO) creates innovative partnerships that build city, community, and College capacity through education. By collaborating with college, industry, and community partners we promote economic development and provide a myriad of employment experiences and opportunities for learners.
Our office was established in 2005 in response to a community need that aligned with the College's mandate to provide pathways to accessible education for non-traditional learners. Linked with multiple partners from every sector - corporate, service, civil society, education, labour and government - we are committed to helping people achieve educational success and to the delivery of projects that lead to improved community health and sustainable employment.

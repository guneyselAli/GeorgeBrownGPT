Thank you for your interest in supporting the George Brown College Foundation by hosting a third-party event. Third-party events are an important part of our fundraising efforts. It is through your support and your events that we are able to reach out and connect with new networks, workplace contacts and community groups. These new connections help us reach our fundraising goals. 
It is easy to support the Foundation by hosting your own third-party event, and we are here to help you get started. Every little bit helps and we appreciate your efforts to help us raise money to support our students at the College.
Once you have decided what type of event you would like to host, please fill out the Third Party Event Procedures form and send it back to us. For more information please contact:

The key to a successful event is all in the planning! Start with brainstorming event ideas, then develop a work plan and set deadlines for tasks to be accomplished. It is also important to ensure that your budget is realistic. Keep detailed records of your expenses as well as your revenue. Make sure everyone involved knows what they are responsible for and accountable to deliver.
Don't forget to promote your event and your fundraising goals! The more people you get involved the more money you can raise. And remember, the Foundation is here to help.

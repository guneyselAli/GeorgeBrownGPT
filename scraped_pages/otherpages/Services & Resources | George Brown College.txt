Our team assists GBC's Indigenous community in navigating resources, providing information on college-wide activities, as well as other services such as counselling, cultural teachings and workshops. For students, we equip you with the skills and tools you need to achieve your academic, work and life goals.
If you have any questions about our offerings, please email us at Indigenous.services@georgebrown.ca.
Our student centres provide a place to meet students and study while having access to job postings, current event listings, technology and more.
There are a number of assistance options available to Indigenous students, including grants, bursaries, scholarships and awards.
The Indigenous land acknowledgment is a statement made at the beginning of George Brown College events to recognize the traditional territory upon which we are situated.
Indigenous students at George Brown College are invited to self-identify so they can access our services.

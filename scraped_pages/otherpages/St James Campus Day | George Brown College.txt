Join us on Thursday, January 4th and explore the St James campus. There will be tours, lab tours, information sessions and workshops, games, giveaways, and a showcase of services and supports all there to ensure you are ready to start your classes.
You'll have the opportunity to meet with faculty, staff, and get to meet some of your classmates. It's shaping up to be a fun day so we hope you'll join us!
While services are limited at this campus due to renovations, we invite students to also explore the facilities at the other campus days as well.
**Please note that there will be photographers/videographers on site for the campus days. If you wish not to be photographed, just let them know.

The George Brown College Foundation aims to raise enough funds to create at least 40 scholarships, ranging between $500-$1,000 each, for our future frontline workers for the Fall.  Students who show dedication to their field of study, community involvement and demonstrate financial need will qualify. 
Your donation will help students in healthcare, construction and other frontline areas.
As one of our generous donors, you can help ensure that financial need doesn't become a barrier to our students' achieving post-secondary education by directing your support to the following areas:
Since 1984, the George Brown College Foundation has helped support the needs of our diverse student population to keep education accessible to all. We do this by raising money for student scholarships and bursaries, as well as for transformational initiatives that strengthen the College's ability to offer programs for specific industries and professions.
Your contributions help to ensure that George Brown College can continue to provide students with the tools and skills they need to succeed, and support the economic, cultural and social well-being of Toronto and the surrounding region.

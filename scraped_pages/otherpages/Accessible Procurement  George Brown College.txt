As mandated by the Ontario government, accessibility criteria and features must be incorporated into all purchasing practices.  It is the responsibility of each employee purchasing a good, service or facility to consider and apply the appropriate accessibility criteria to their purchasing decisions.  If it is not practicable to incorporate accessibility criteria or features, you must be ready to provide an explanation upon request.
The Ontario Colleges Procurement Toolkit was developed to support accessible procurement processes in the sector.
Please visit the Procurement Department for additional procurement-related information.
Below are some external resources to assist you.

If you require further assistance in sourcing accessible criteria or features, contact the AODA Coordinator.

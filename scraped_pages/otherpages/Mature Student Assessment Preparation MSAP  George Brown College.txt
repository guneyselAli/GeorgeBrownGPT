George Brown College’s free Mature Student Assessment Preparation (MSAP) program is designed to support all mature students who have applied to an Ontario college program and are required to write the Mature Student Admissions Assessment in either English and/ or Math.
Evening classes (online) start every three weeks. Sign up today.
The application process is easy. Click below on the course you are interested in attending – Math or English (you may take both at the same time). You will be directed to an online registration page, where you will choose the session date that best suits your needs.
*New pandemic steps* Once you have completed registering, you will call our secure voicemail to leave your Social Insurance Number. This is necessary to comply with Ministry and College requirements.
After you complete the above steps, you will receive an email confirming your place in class, along with a link to the online platform (Canvas, uses Zoom as well).

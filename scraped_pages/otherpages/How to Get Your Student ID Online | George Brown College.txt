ATTENTION: The GBC Digital Student ID is your primary GBC ID and can be accessed through the George Brown App. For more information on how to install the George Brown app, please visit our Mobile Apps Support page. Students can request a physical ID card to be printed through the Photo Submission/Validation website.
To avoid time-consuming lineups, consider preprinting your student ID card. Preprinting allows you to select a convenient pickup location and reduces the amount of time it takes to obtain your card.
To set up your Digital Student ID, you will need:
Most full-time students in the college’s post-secondary programs have been charged a non-refundable $12 student ID fee as a part of tuitions administration fee in the first semester of their program.
If you are a student registered as part-time in a full-time post-secondary program, you have NOT pre-paid the student ID fee. You will have to pay the $12 student ID fee before you create your Digital Student ID.
You can pay for your Student ID online through STU-View.

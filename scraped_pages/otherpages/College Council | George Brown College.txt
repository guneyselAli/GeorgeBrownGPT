College Council represents the entire college community and includes representatives from faculty, administrative staff, support staff and students. The mandate of the council is to represent the college community in providing timely feedback to the President on issues that are of college-wide significance.
In fulfilling these responsibilities, College Council establishes annual goals aligned with the college's strategic priorities as determined by the Board of Governors and the Senior Management Committee.
While College Council generally provides a college wide perspective on issues of strategic significance, College Council may also consider and advise on operational issues when relevant.

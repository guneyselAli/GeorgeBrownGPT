Join us on Wednesday, January 3rd and explore the Waterfront campus. There will be tours, information sessions and workshops, games, giveaways, and a showcase of services and supports all there to ensure you are ready to start your classes.
You'll have the opportunity to meet with faculty, staff, and get to meet some of your classmates. It's shaping up to be a fun day so we hope you'll join us!
Students are invited to join their own campus days, but are welcome to explore the facilities at the other campus days as well.
**Please note that there will be photographers/videographers onsite for the campus days. If you wish not to be photographed, just let them know.

Changes to our LLC Laptop Loan Policy as of December 18, 2023; visit Library News & Services to read more.
iPads can be borrowed for up to 7 days, with the possibility of two renewals (subject to availability). iPad pens are compatible and can be charged by being directly plugged into the iPad. For creative types, if you are better at drawing with a pen than a computer mouse, you must give a Wacom tablet a try!
We ask that you please return all technology equipment to the LLC location you borrowed it from. 
LLC iPads come preloaded with a number of apps including specialized program content that are specific to classes taught at each campus location. See our Computers & Software page for more information.


Ontario legislation specifies certain surveillance requirements for those individuals entering into healthcare,  dental or field work practice settings. This program policy was developed in accordance with the Communicable Disease Surveillance protocols, specified under the Ontario Public Health, Ontario Hospital Association, Ontario Medical Association, Long Term Care Association and Ontario School Boards. These measures are necessary to protect your health and safety, and the health and safety of the patients, employees, seniors, children and other vulnerable population at the organization or facility offering you a placement.   


ParaMed and George Brown College Partnership




The Placement Pass Program provided by ParaMed is the service approved by George Brown College to manage the clearance process for these surveillance requirements.  ParaMed and George Brown College have a long-standing partnership that began in 2008. ParaMedâ€™s qualified and experienced nurses are responsible for reviewing the Health Form documents and supporting certificates for all Full-time and Continuing Education students who are registered in Community Services, Health Sciences and Hospitality programs to determine if you have met and are eligible to be part of upcoming clinical,  dental or field work practice per semester and academic year.

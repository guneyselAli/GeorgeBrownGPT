The George Brown College Assessment Centre offers a variety of test options for college applicants and students.
Admission Assessments in English, Math and Science are taken by George Brown College applicants over the age of 19 as part of the application process.
Placement Assessments in English or Math are taken by most students after they have accepted an offer of admission to George Brown College. 
If you successfully complete a trade exemption test, you may be exempt from some of the formal, in-class instruction required for your apprenticeship.
If you want to take selected English courses through Continuing Education, you will be required to take the GEA and/or GMA to ensure that you register in the course appropriate to your skill level. 
All workers who perform Type 3 Asbestos Abatement work must pass this examination. The examination was developed by the Ministry of Colleges and Universities and is taken by workers after they complete the Asbestos Type 3 training program.
The Assessment Centre also offers services for non-George Brown College students to write exam(s) from another institution/organization at our Casa Loma Campus Assessment Centre.

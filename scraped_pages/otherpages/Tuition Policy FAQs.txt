If you have questions, please contact accountsreceivable@georgebrown.ca
Ancillary Fees and Opting Out
Why are ancillary fees no longer optional?
The Student Choice Initiative (SCI) — introduced by the provincial government in 2019 — gave post-secondary students the ability to opt out of ancillary fees deemed to be "non-essential" by the Ministry of College and Universities.
However, an Ontario Divisional Court subsequently struck down this policy following a legal challenge by the Canadian Federation of Students and the York Federation of Students. As a result, ancillary fees deemed non-essential due to the SCI policy will regain mandatory status as of the Fall 2020 academic term.
However, the Student Levy and Health Insurance will remain optional, as they were prior to the SCI. See Question 18 for more information on how to opt out of these fees.
How do I opt out from the Student Levy or the Student Health and Dental Insurance Plan?
To opt out of the Student Levy, log into your STU-VIEW account and select Financial Services > View Fees. A detailed breakdown of your fees will be displayed, as well as an opt-out button for the Student Levy ONLY. The deadline to opt-out is prior to Day 10 of each term.
To opt out of the extended Health and Dental Plan, please visit studentassociation.ca/health and apply to opt out prior to the posted deadlines. Students are responsible for reading the benefits booklet, available at wespeakstudent.com.
Withdrawals and Refunds
How do I withdraw from my program?
Prior to withdrawing from your program, you are strongly encouraged to speak to an
				academic advisor to explore your options. In many cases, there may be an alternative to withdrawing from college altogether.
To officially withdraw from your program, you must submit a withdrawal request via one of the following methods:

Log in to your STU-VIEW account, select Registration Services, and then follow the links to withdraw from your program.

Write a letter stating your intention to withdraw, and including your student ID number and the program code. This withdrawal request must be sent from your George Brown College email account to registration@georgebrown.ca

A full refund of any tuition fees paid in advance for future semesters.

For some programs — such as the dental programs — please note that material fees may be non-refundable if you withdraw after the start of classes.

How and when will I receive my refund?

Sponsored Students and Scholarship Recipients
I am being sponsored or I have a scholarship. Do I need to pay the deposit?

However, you will receive a refund once your sponsoring agency — e.g. First Nation Band, Employer, etc. — or your scholarship provider has paid your fees.
If you do not wish to make a payment, you must provide the original letter from your sponsoring agency or scholarship provider confirming that fees will be paid. Please email registration@georgebrown.ca to submit this letter and to be registered by a member of the Registration department.
Important: Acceptance of the sponsoring agency letter is at the discretion of George Brown College.
What if my education is being funded through Canadian Scholarship Trust Plan, CPP, RESP, or USC?
Canadian Scholarship Trust Plan, CPP, RESP, or USC: If you are receiving monies from one of these sources, the Registrar's Office will complete and sign the necessary forms upon receipt, and return them to the originator.

Am I eligible for a payment plan?
You may be eligible for a payment plan if you are a post-secondary student who meets all of the following criteria for the semester:

You have registered for classes
You are a domestic student (new or returning) OR a returning international student
You have a minimum $1000 balance of fees owing

You can apply for a payment plan each term through STU-VIEW > Financial Services once you have registered for classes for the term.
If you have questions, please contact accountsreceivable@georgebrown.ca
Ancillary Fees and Opting Out
Why are ancillary fees no longer optional?
The Student Choice Initiative (SCI) — introduced by the provincial government in 2019 — gave post-secondary students the ability to opt out of ancillary fees deemed to be "non-essential" by the Ministry of College and Universities.
However, an Ontario Divisional Court subsequently struck down this policy following a legal challenge by the Canadian Federation of Students and the York Federation of Students. As a result, ancillary fees deemed non-essential due to the SCI policy will regain mandatory status as of the Fall 2020 academic term.
However, the Student Levy and Health Insurance will remain optional, as they were prior to the SCI. See Question 18 for more information on how to opt out of these fees.
How do I opt out from the Student Levy or the Student Health and Dental Insurance Plan?
To opt out of the Student Levy, log into your STU-VIEW account and select Financial Services > View Fees. A detailed breakdown of your fees will be displayed, as well as an opt-out button for the Student Levy ONLY. The deadline to opt-out is prior to Day 10 of each term.
To opt out of the extended Health and Dental Plan, please visit studentassociation.ca/health and apply to opt out prior to the posted deadlines. Students are responsible for reading the benefits booklet, available at wespeakstudent.com.
Withdrawals and Refunds
How do I withdraw from my program?
Prior to withdrawing from your program, you are strongly encouraged to speak to an
				academic advisor to explore your options. In many cases, there may be an alternative to withdrawing from college altogether.
To officially withdraw from your program, you must submit a withdrawal request via one of the following methods:

Log in to your STU-VIEW account, select Registration Services, and then follow the links to withdraw from your program.

Write a letter stating your intention to withdraw, and including your student ID number and the program code. This withdrawal request must be sent from your George Brown College email account to registration@georgebrown.ca


Important Notes

If you have applied for an OSAP loan, you must also inform Financial Assistance (OSAP) of your decision to withdraw.

What is the last day to withdraw from my program?

I need to withdraw from my program. Will I get a refund?
To be eligible for a partial refund, you must withdraw from your program by the published refund deadline. If so, you will receive:

A full refund of tuition fees for the semester, less the non-refundable deposit*, AND
A full refund of any tuition fees paid in advance for future semesters.

For some programs — such as the dental programs — please note that material fees may be non-refundable if you withdraw after the start of classes.
After the refund deadline, you will still be able to withdraw from a course (or entire program) until the withdrawal without academic penalty deadline. However, no refund for the current semester will be issued in this case.
* Note: International Students will receive a full refund of tuition fees for the semester, less a $1,000 withdrawal fee for the majority of programs. The International EAP program (R115), will have a withdrawal fee of $675 for an eight week session. Please refer to the International Student Withdrawal & Refund Policy for further information.
Under what circumstances is the deposit refundable?
The deposit is non-refundable, except in one of the following circumstances:
New Students: If you have accepted a conditional offer that is later revoked due to not meeting the conditions of the offer, or if your offer is revoked for any other reason, you will receive a complete refund of all tuition fees paid relating to that offer (including the deposit).
Returning Students: If you are not eligible to continue in your program based on an Academic Hold — i.e. a Divisional Hold (AC) or an Advising Hold (AD) — the deposit and any tuition fees paid will be refunded.
How and when will I receive my refund?
If you are eligible for a refund, the college will process your refund through EMT (Email Money Transfer) to your George Brown College email account through STU-VIEW. It is your responsibility to monitor your George Brown College email account and ensure that your STU-VIEW account is active. Our usual processing time for refunds is two weeks. Refund by cheque is no longer an option.
Sponsored Students and Scholarship Recipients
I am being sponsored or I have a scholarship. Do I need to pay the deposit?
Yes, you must pay the deposit by your due date in order to register for classes online and hold your seat in the program (if you are a new student). However, you will receive a refund once your sponsoring agency — e.g. First Nation Band, Employer, etc. — or your scholarship provider has paid your fees.
If you do not wish to make a payment, you must provide the original letter from your sponsoring agency or scholarship provider confirming that fees will be paid. Please email registration@georgebrown.ca to submit this letter and to be registered by a member of the Registration department.
Important: Acceptance of the sponsoring agency letter is at the discretion of George Brown College.
What if my education is being funded through Canadian Scholarship Trust Plan, CPP, RESP, or USC?
Canadian Scholarship Trust Plan, CPP, RESP, or USC: If you are receiving monies from one of these sources, the Registrar's Office will complete and sign the necessary forms upon receipt, and return them to the originator.
However, it is still your responsibility to pay your deposit and final fees by the deadline, even if you have not received your money.
International Students
I am an international student. Does the above information apply to me?
Yes, most of the above information also applies to international students, however, there are some important differences in the tuition policy for international students:

New international students are required to pay the first semester fees upon accepting their offer.
Returning international students are required to pay an initial minimum deposit once per academic year of $4,000. This deposit will be applied towards the student's tuition and fees for their first semester of study in the Academic Year, and will be due on the same date as the Domestic Students.
Fees for subsequent semesters will be due on the same dates as the Domestic Students (non-OSAP recipients).
Late payment penalties will apply in the same way as Domestic Students.
All withdrawal and refund deadlines remain unchanged. However, International Students will be charged a $1,000 withdrawal fee for the majority of programs. The International EAP program (R115), will have a withdrawal fee of $675 for an eight week session. New and returning students should refer to the
					International Student Withdrawal & Refund Policy for further information.

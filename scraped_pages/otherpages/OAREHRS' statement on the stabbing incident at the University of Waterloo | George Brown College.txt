The Office of Anti-Racism, Equity and Human Rights Services (OAREHRS) is distressed and deeply saddened to hear about the stabbing incident at the University of Waterloo on Wednesday, June 28, 2023. We particularly condemn this incident of gender-based and transphobic violence, targeting a Gender Issues course within the Philosophy Department and Gender and Social Justice Program.
Hatred and hate-motivated violence must not be tolerated and has no place in our classrooms, schools, or communities.
We reaffirm George Brown College’s commitment to protecting 2SLGBTQIA+ people and gender-marginalized folks from violence, discrimination, and harassment. The college also commits to fostering an environment free of all forms of gender-based violence, sexual harassment, and sexual assault.
OAREHRS has expanded our capacity to include two Gender-Based and Sexual Violence Response Advisors, a Gender and Sexual Violence Prevention Coordinator and an Awareness & Education Program Coordinator. This month, OAREHRS led four college-wide trainings on 2SLGBTQIA+ Fundamentals to Action and will continue offering educational initiatives like these alongside spaces for 2SLGBTQIA+ people to gather, to strengthen our commitments to 2SLGBTQIA+ safety and belonging.
It is important for all of us to recognize our responsibilities to disrupt gender essentialism, transphobia, and gender-based discrimination in all the ways they appear, both overt and subtle, in our lives.
Our thoughts are with the University of Waterloo community members, particularly trans, nonbinary, two-spirit, and gender-diverse people, along with broader 2SLGBTQIA+ communities, who are impacted by this attack.
Please know that support is available.

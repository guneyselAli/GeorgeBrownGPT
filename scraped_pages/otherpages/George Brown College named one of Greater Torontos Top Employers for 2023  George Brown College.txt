We are very proud to be named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers for 2023 — the seventh straight year we’ve made the list.
The Greater Toronto’s Top Employers 2023 report was published in the Globe and Mail on Dec. 9. It highlights the reasons George Brown was once again chosen as a top employer, which include:
“We’re a learning organization, and we invest in our staff to make sure they too are investing in their growth, beyond what they do day to day,” explains Susan Bowrah, VP People and Culture at George Brown. “The professional development leave can be tied to your career or a different kind of learning. It’s a way for people to get out of the workforce for a bit and focus on themselves. It really encourages creativity and self-development, and we see a lot of value coming from it.”
Organizations are selected for the Top Employers list based on eight criteria including physical workplace; work atmosphere; health, financial, and family benefits; vacation and time off; employee communications; performance management; training and skills development; and community involvement.
Flexibility and self-care have been recurring themes among this year’s winners. Employers are adapting their policies to ensure staff are better able to balance work and personal commitments, taking the necessary time to rest and recharge. George Brown is proud to be one of those employers who prioritize the needs of their employees.

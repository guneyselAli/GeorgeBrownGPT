John (Jack) Hanna founded his company, John Hanna & Sons Ltd., with his son Ian in 1978. Over the following decades, this company grew to represent some of the great family-owned wineries of the world.
Jack was a remarkable man and a respected member of the wine trade. His love of life and of good wine paled only in comparison to how most of his friends and competitors felt about him.  He always had time for those in need and his generosity of spirit defined him. Ultimately, young people and education were his passion.
The John Hanna Advanced Wine and Beverage Business Management Post-Graduate Scholarship has been established in recognition of Jack’s dedication to his industry and to young people who share this passion.

Students will solve probability problems involving a single or multiple events, solve application problems, and learn different probability distributions. In addition, students will analyze and draw conclusions from one and two-variable data by utilizing various numerical, graphical and algebraic summaries. At the mid-point and again at the end of the course, students will create, investigate and present a problem using the skills and concepts they attain throughout the course.

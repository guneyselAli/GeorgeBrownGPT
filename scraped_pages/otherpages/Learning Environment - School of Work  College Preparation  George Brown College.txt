The George Brown College School of Work and College Preparation provides a different approach to conventional methods of learning. The school offers smaller classrooms and built-in support like Pathway Advisors who help students plan and achieve educational goals and career exploration. Students are free to explore their options, and investigate program streams in order discover their primary areas of interest and passions. With the guidance and advice of our School of Work and College Preparation team we help create supportive learning environments for students.
George Brownâ€™s learning environment has a strong international component. In addition to sharing a classroom with international students from around the world you have several opportunities for international fieldwork and international field trips. You can also take advantage of academic pathways available to various education institutions overseas. The GBC curriculum benefits from our many global partnerships and our credentials are geared towards preparing you for the global marketplace.

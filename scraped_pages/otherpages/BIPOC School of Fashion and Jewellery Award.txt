The employees of the School of Fashion and Jewellery have created a new award supporting BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Colour) students pursuing their education. The BIPOC School of Fashion and Jewellery award aims to elevate underrepresented voices in our community and our industries, allowing equal access to opportunities to build their fashion and jewellery careers with success.
For more information on this award, please contact Rosa Fracassa, Acting Chair, School of Fashion and Jewellery, at rfracass@georgebrown.caÂ

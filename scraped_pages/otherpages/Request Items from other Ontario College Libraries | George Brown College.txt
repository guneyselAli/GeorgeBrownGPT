George Brown College students, faculty and staff can request items from other Ontario College Libraries through our Inter-Library Loan (ILL) service. Please note, this service is not available to alumni or external borrowers.
This service allows you to request books, DVDs, videos and articles that are not available at George Brown College but may be obtained through our Inter-Library Loan arrangements with other libraries in the Ontario Community College system.
This process takes time. Items may take at least two weeks to arrive at your College Library. You will be notified by e-mail or phone when they become available.
To submit a request for an Inter-Library Loan, please fill out the appropriate form (below) with all the required information. You may also request this form at the Library Reference Desk or email: illo@georgebrown.ca if you have any questions.

Students, staff and faculty may borrow any available items from any other Ontario Community College library, using your George Brown library card. 
All such borrowing is subject to the terms of the library that holds the item. The Direct Borrower Agreement provides all the details you require to proceed.
Remember, you will be required to return materials directly to the library where you signed them out (i.e.NOT your campus George Brown Library).

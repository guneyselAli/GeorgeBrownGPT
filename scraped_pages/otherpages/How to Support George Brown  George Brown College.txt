Take a look at our most recent Capital Campaign, the expansion of our School of Design.
You can quickly and easily donate online today!
Endowed funds get invested into programs of your choice, providing financial support for the college.
You can help ensure that no student is denied a George Brown education because of financial burden.
You will receive a tax receipt for the full value of publicly traded shares donated, but you won't be taxed on any gain.
These events are a great way to help usÂ meet our fundraising goals.
A legacy gift allows you to make a gift to charity that will either be realized later or through your estate.
These gifts are a wonderful way to remember a special person while helping others.
We're able to convert your miles into funds.

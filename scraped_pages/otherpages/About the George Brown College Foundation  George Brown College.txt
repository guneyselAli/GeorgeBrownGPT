The George Brown College Foundation, established in 1984, is a separately incorporated registered charity that serves as the primary fundraising vehicle for George Brown College. The Foundation is guided by a volunteer Board of Directors who support the College’s mandate of increasing access to education by raising money to support student success through scholarships, bursaries and awards.
Together with the college, we work to advance George Brown’s commitment to excellence in teaching, applied learning and innovation, as well as its commitment to access, diversity and mutual respect. Together with our donors, we work to ensure that no student is denied a post-secondary education at George Brown College because of financial constraints.
George Brown College is dedicated to providing the highest possible calibre of education to its students and to making its programs accessible to all. The Foundation helps the College achieve this goal by raising money to support student success through scholarships and bursaries as well as through larger initiatives that strengthen the College’s ability to offer programs for specific industries and professions.

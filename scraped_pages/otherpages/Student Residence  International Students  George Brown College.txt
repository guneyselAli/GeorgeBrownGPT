Living in residence not only provides International students an incredible place to study, rest and relax but also offers an opportunity for personal growth through new friendships, social events, volunteer opportunities and more. 
Toronto is a great city, with lots to see and do. Don’t let the hassles of off-campus housing hold you back!
By living in residence, George Brown students can focus on their academics and exploring the city, while avoiding the hassles of furnishing an apartment, finding a roommate, splitting monthly bills with roommates, commuting to class, dealing with landlords when something is broken, and setting up internet/television and phone service.
Instantly become part of an exciting and unique community when arriving at the residence. Our Residence Life team hosts a number of student activities and events on almost a daily basis. From cooking classes, and movie nights, to Blue Jays Baseball games and scavenger hunts, there are endless community events. Participating in Early Move-In Orientation is a great way to get a head start on developing friendships, and learning about your new community.

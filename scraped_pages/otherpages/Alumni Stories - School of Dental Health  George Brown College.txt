"I've been in dental for 22 years and going back to school was one of the best decisions I have ever made. The Restorative Dental Hygiene program at George Brown College has been an amazing experience, with curriculum that incorporates all the skills needed to be successful in any dental practice. The instructors have been some of the best I've ever had. In the clinic they were both helpful and insightful in their constructive pointers on how to succeed by putting the theory learned in the classroom into practice when working on live patients. I feel privileged that I was able to partake in this course."

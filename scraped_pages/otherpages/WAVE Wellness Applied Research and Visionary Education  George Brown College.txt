We believe that students learn by doing. That’s why we’ve created the WAVE (Wellness, Applied Research and Visionary Education) - a series of health and wellness clinics that provide services for the public like dental care, and hearing tests. These clinics help our students practice their newly learned skills on real clients in real-world environments while being supervised by faculty.
Download our WAVE brochure  for a full list of fees and services.
Clients visiting one of our WAVE Clinics must register and pay here before any scheduled WAVE appointment.
Visit this clinic if you need dental services like dental cleanings, restorations, dentures and teeth whitening. Our students from the School of Dental Health are here to help!
Due to Public Health requirements, the services typically provided by the WAVE Hearing Clinic are not currently available. Please check this page for updates.

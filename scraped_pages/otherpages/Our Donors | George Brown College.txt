2019-2020 was a transformative year, both for George Brown College and the world around us. We kicked off the academic year with the launch of our new strategic plan, Imagining Possibilities: Vision 2030/Strategy 2022, which harnessed the bold thinking of our community to define the future of education at George Brown. The innovative, collaborative mindset outlined in this plan guided us throughout 2019-20 as we introduced new partnerships, state-of-the-art learning and research facilities, and new ways of teaching and learning.Â

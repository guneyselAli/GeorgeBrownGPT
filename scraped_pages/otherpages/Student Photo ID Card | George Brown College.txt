ATTENTION: The GBC Digital Student ID is your primary GBC ID and can be accessed through the George Brown App. For more information on how to install the George Brown app, please visit our Mobile Apps Support page. Students can request a physical ID card to be printed through the Photo Submission/Validation website.
Your GBC student card identifies you as a George Brown College student and gives you access to many college services and facilities.
Submit your photo online, select a pickup location and collect your new ID Card from the Library Learning Commons.
Always carry your student ID card as you'll need it to access services and participate in academic activities.
If your student ID card is lost or stolen, you will need to report it and order a replacement.
Students in Early Childhood Education programs who attend classes at Toronto Metropolitan University need a OneCard. This card specifically identifies you as a George Brown College student on the Toronto Metropolitan University campus.

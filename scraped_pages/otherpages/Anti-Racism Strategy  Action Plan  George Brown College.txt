Over the years, we at George Brown have acknowledged and affirmed our commitment to addressing racism and inequities and engaging in anti-racism, equity, and inclusion efforts. The past year has precipitated an opportunity for deeper reflection on how we will demonstrate our commitment. What we have heard from leaders, employees, and students who have shared their stories and provided feedback and insights is that George Brown needs to move forward more boldly. Our deeds must match our commitments. Meaningful action is needed, and the time for more action is now.
Find out how we’re taking meaningful, deliberate, and sustained action to address racism, inequities, and discrimination.

To facilitate student success, the George Brown College Foundation works with donors to create endowment scholarships and student awards.
With an endowment, donors sign an agreement to invest an amount in perpetuity. The annual interest generated on this amount is presented as a student award and endowments can be named in recognition of the donor(s). Some donors want their awards to be a certain monetary value and make an annual donation ‘top-up’ to ensure the award value remains consistent each year.
The principal in an endowment is never expended, so the award is presented in perpetuity.
The annual selection of a student to receive an award is determined by the GBC Financial Aid Office and Faculty and is based on criteria established in an endowment or award agreement. For more information, please feel free to contact Krisztina Arany, Senior Development Officer at the George Brown College Foundation at 416-415-5000 ext.: 4356 or by email at karany@georgebrown.ca.

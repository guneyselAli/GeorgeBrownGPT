Please note that George Brown College has now joined the MyCreds™ platform. Going forward, the Academic Records department will now be issuing official transcripts, confirmation of enrolment letters, and credentials via MyCreds!
MyCreds is Canada’s new, official credential wallet for postsecondary learners and graduates, owned by the Association of Registrars of the Universities and Colleges of Canada (ARUCC). George Brown College students and alumni will be able to access and share their official transcripts, credentials, and confirmation of enrolment letters through this secure platform.
 You may now request your official records by filling out the following request form:
Academic Records Request Form
We are currently accepting requests for the following documents:Official TranscriptsConfirmation of Enrolment (COE) Letters for Domestic StudentsCOE letters for 2023-24 will be issued starting November 20, 2023. International students may continue to request COE letters via the Letter Request for International Students form.
The Academic Records team will review and process your request within 3-4 business days.
(We will begin issuing credentials via MyCreds later this month. Please note that future graduates do not need to request their credentials; your digitized credential will be issued to MyCreds automatically a few weeks after the end of each term, and a hard copy will be provided via mail or at your convocation ceremony.)

The Black Student Success Network (BSSN) is a student driven initiative based on the following grounded pillars:
The BSSN was the result of college-wide research that showed a significant number of Black students at the School of Social and Community Services were leaving their programs early. Students were consulted and invited to share their experiences and provide solutions. Their input created the foundation of BSSN.
The network ran as a pilot project for the 2016-17 academic year for students in Social and Community Services programs. Throughout the year, we heard from other students across the college requesting that BSSN support them; in Fall 2017 we expanded our support of black student success to other programs and campuses across the College.
Black students at George Brown College are not the only group who has needs around learning in a culturally responsive, safe, equitable, and inclusive environment. This is why the work that BSSN is doing is so valuable to the George Brown College community, as it provides an opportunity to develop best practices and guidelines on innovative ways to support, engage and retain a growing number of “diverse” students looking to grow and learn at the college. The success of the BSSN is an additional positive step in the college’s commitment to a healthy campus environment where each students’ and staffs’ unique perspective and experiences are acknowledged and valued.

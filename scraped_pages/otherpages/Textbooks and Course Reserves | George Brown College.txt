Course Reserves are required or recommended readings, books, articles textbooks or class notes that your instructor has placed on reserve for you to use.
Many course reserve textbooks can be found in self-serve kiosks located outside of the Library Learning Commons at Casa Loma, Waterfront, and St. James campuses, while some are located inside the libraries at the Circulation and Help Desks. Please bring the title of the item and your instructor’s name so library staff can help retrieve the item for you.
Remember, you will require your current Student ID/Library Card to use these items. *All course reserves are not renewable.
To place heavy-demand books, chapters, journal articles, or audio-visual materials on Reserve, instructors must fill out the Reserve Form (PDF) and each article must be cleared by the Copyright Librarian. Instructors are reminded to give ample time for copyright clearance. Further information is available on the Faculty Services guide.
For more information regarding copyright clearance of course reserves, please check Copyright Help! or contact Heather Buffett, Copyright Librarian at ext. 6947.

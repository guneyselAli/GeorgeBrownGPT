Thinking about a career in nursing?
If caring for others gives your life purpose, you have the personal qualifications to become a nurse working in a rewarding profession that is experiencing unprecedented growth.
The Sally Horsfall Eaton School of Nursing offers certificate, diploma and degree programs that can lead you into teaching, research, health care administration, and even sales.
You will study in our state-of-the-art Daphne Cockwell Centre for Health Sciences at the Waterfront Campus and will learn the required skills from faculty members who are actively involved in health care. 
We enhance your learning experience using our Simulation Centre where you’ll apply your learning in true-to-life practice situations on high-tech mannequins - the next best thing to human patients!
Each of our nursing programs is biology and science-based and our programs offer clinical placement to further ensure your job-readiness.
Our Entry Advising service is a free service provided by the college to help match your skills, background and career goals with program options.
Attend an information session to learn more about our programs and have your questions answered by our knowledgeable faculty and staff.

George Brown College
Impact Report 2018â2019

            As technological advances transform Ontarioâs labour market, George Brown College is preparing the
            innovative,
            adaptable graduates our province needs to fill emerging jobs in new sectors. Blending theory with
            experiential learning,
            applied research and entrepreneurship opportunities, our programs deliver the skills industry needs most â
            both now and
            into the future â and prepare learners to thrive in a world of rapid change.
        

            Our three campuses anchor neighbourhoods throughout Toronto, supporting the growth of our city and the
            success of its
            diverse communities. George Brown is integral to the social and economic success of Ontario.
        

                A strong economy requires a highly skilled workforce. George Brown programs are developed in
                consultation with industry and designed to meet the rapidly changing needs of the labour market. We
                connect employers to top talent, train and retrain students to meet evolving industry needs, and help
                fill critical vacancies across the GTA and beyond.
            

                To ensure a smooth transition into the labour market, weâve made experiential learning a top priority.
                George Brown students have meaningful access to industry through work-integrated learning opportunities,
                industry projects, interactive simulations, capstone projects and more, enabling them to develop the
                technical skills and soft skills employers value most.

                    in

                As one of Ontarioâs top research colleges, we support small and medium-sized businesses in accessing the
                expertise, equipment and funding support they need to develop innovative products and services. Working
                with students and employees in state-of-the-art facilities, our partners conduct applied research
                projects ranging from food and beverage development to sustainable construction, while helping prepare
                job-ready graduates with the skills to innovate and lead.

                Our campuses are woven into the fabric of Torontoâs diverse communities, with many students providing
                services to our neighbours as part of their experiential learning. As the college grows, weâre helping
                our city grow â both by anchoring new communities along Torontoâs waterfront and by educating a new
                generation of nurses, early childhood educators, entrepreneurs, construction managers, chefs,
                gerontology workers, business and community leaders, volunteers and more.

George Brown College is poised to transform Toronto’s skyline and push the envelope when it comes to sustainability with the construction of a 10-storey mass-timber building called Limberlost Place at our Waterfront Campus. This innovative project marks an important continuation of George Brown’s role as a city builder. Limberlost Place will provide exciting learning spaces for our students, a home for a mass-timber research hub and vital community space for the surrounding neighbourhood. It will be Ontario’s first mass-timber, low-carbon institutional building. For more information on how to support Limberlost Place, please contact Allan Penning, Chief Development Officer, at allan.penning@georgebrown.ca.

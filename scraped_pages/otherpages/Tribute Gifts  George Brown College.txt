A memorial gift or gift in honour is a wonderful way to remember a special person while helping others. Thoughtful memorial gifts and gifts in honour make it possible for us to continue supporting student access to education.
After you have made your contribution in memory or in honour, an acknowledgement letter or email will be sent to the person(s) you designate and a tax receipt will be sent to you. We do not specify the amount of the donation unless you request it and you may customize your message to the recipient. If you need notification of a donation in memory or in honour to arrive more quickly, please choose to donate and send an e-card below.
Memorial and tribute donations to George Brown College Foundation are fully tax-deductible.
To make a gift in honour or in memory, simply indicate on the donation form the person you would like to pay tribute to.

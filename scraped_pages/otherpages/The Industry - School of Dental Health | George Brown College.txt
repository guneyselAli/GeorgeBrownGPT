In the past several years, the dental industry has been focused on promoting the connection between oral health and overall health, with the goal of having connected health care teams. The School of Dental Healthâ€™s curriculum reflects that trend. We emphasize an interprofessional education model that highlights an awareness of other professions and practices to broaden the understanding of patient care. From the beginning of their training, our students experience a unique approach to oral health that reflects the emerging trends in the industry.

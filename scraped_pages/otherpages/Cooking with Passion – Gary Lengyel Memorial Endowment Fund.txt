The late Gary Lengyel's legacy will continue on and inspire others through the creation of the Cooking with Passion – Gary Lengyel Memorial Endowment fund. This fund was created in partnership by Peter Lengyel and the Guild Electric Charitable Foundation to support culinary students at George Brown College's Centre for Hospitality and Culinary Arts (CHCA).
Gary, an avid cook, became deeply interested in the culinary arts in his twenties. He enrolled in George Brown's Culinary School in 1978. Here he took his passion for food and wine to the next level, elevating his knowledge and repertoire in the industry. Although Gary continued to work professionally at Guild Electric, he always made time to share his love for food and wine with those around him.
Gary once said, "My very best times, and the crowning achievement of any Chef, is a room filled with family and good friends having just eaten a great meal!" It is with his passion for food in mind that Peter and the Guild Electric Charitable Foundation chose to establish the "Cooking with Passion – Gary Lengyel Endowment" in Gary's name.

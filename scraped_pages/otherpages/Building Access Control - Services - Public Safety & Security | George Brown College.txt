To access any building after hours written notice is required 24 hours in advance of needed entry to the Facilities Help Desk, who will inform security.
Think of your ID card as a key.  When the doors are locked (light will be red), simply place your card up to the reader and, if you are authorized to enter through the door, the strike on the door will unlock and you can open the door. The process is fairly quick and what is actually happening involves communication between the reader and your GBC Access card. 
Requesting changes to a Student, Staff, or Employee access card is the responsibility of the department/ unit’s Departmental Access Key Controller (DAKC), or Department Manager. The DAKC or Manager will notify the GBC Access Control Office at Accesscontrol@georgebrown.ca and request modifications be made to the card. If your employment status or responsibilities necessitate your access levels be updated, simply advise your DAKC/ Manager who will notify the Access Control Office. 
It is sometimes difficult to determine why there are problems with door access. It could be a failed card or even a failed reader, it could be something mechanical preventing the door from opening or closing, or it could be the person is not authorized for access to a particular door or their access has expired. The most effective way to resolve the problem is to help identify what might be causing it. If there is a problem with any of the equipment or access for an individual, the departmental/ unit's DAKC or Manager should be the first point of contact. Often the issue is the person is not authorized for access to a particular door or their access has expired. If it has been determined the issue is due to equipment failure, the DAKC or Manager should contact the GBC Access Control Office at Accesscontrol@georgebrown.ca  to report the problem. 
In 2011 the George Brown College Public Safety & Security Division and the Office of the Vice President Corporate Services developed a set of security standards involving card access and enhanced security requirements for the College. The card access and enhanced security requirements are intended to mitigate risk to the college community and college assets.A set of card access guidelines has been developed for the interior of campus buildings including the following areas: research and research support; technology server rooms; rooms necessary for the major systems operations of buildings; and any other areas that may be categorized as sensitive due to the nature of the information, activity, or equipment stored.

Are you ready to start your academic career but aren’t sure what your area of study should be?
Our program offerings address a broad range of student needs depending on where you are along your educational and/or career path. We offer English as a Second Language (ESL) programs, as well as preparatory programs to help students transition to further post-secondary education at George Brown or other institutions. Our General Arts and Science Two-Year diploma program now offers a pathway for eligible students to transfer credits to the University of Toronto. 
We support newcomers to Canada through our immigrant bridging programs. Our Occupation Specific Language Training (OSLT), College Teacher Training and Workplace Communication for Nurses programs are specifically designed to help you make use of the education and work experience you have acquired internationally.
Watch this video to hear our English as a Second Language students say ‘Welcome to a class of your own’ in their first language.

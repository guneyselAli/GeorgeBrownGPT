Season’s greetings from the George Brown College Foundation. This holiday season, please consider supporting students by making a donation to our Holiday Campaign.
This campaign is supporting the Student Association’s Student Nutrition Access Program (SNAP) at George Brown College. The program provides support on the nutrition, health and wellness needs of George Brown College students to help them succeed academically. With the rising costs of living, your donation can make a difference to students’ academic and career goals.
100% of your donation will go to George Brown College students, no processing fees or administration fees will be applied to your gift. For donations of $20+ made before this year’s end, your donation will elicit an electronic copy of your tax receipt from the Foundation.
For additional information, please contact Gabriella Goutam at the George Brown College Foundation at gabriella.goutam@georgebrown.ca or 416-415-5000 x 3289. 
Thanks again for your ongoing generosity. Wishing you and your loved ones a safe and happy holiday season.

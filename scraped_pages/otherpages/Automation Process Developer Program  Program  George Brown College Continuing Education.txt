formerly Robotics Process Automation Program
Our Automation Process Developer Program was developed because one of the fastest-growing trends in enterprise software development is process automation. Process automation enables businesses to automate repetitive tasks and procedures, thus enabling an organization’s workforce to invest their time in more complex, higher-value activities. Qualified process automation practitioners who are able to plan, analyze, design, develop, and manage automation solutions are critical to an organization’s ability to leverage the benefits of software automation. The courses in this program help you get the knowledge, skills, and tools you need to determine the processes that may be suitable for automation, design/develop software automation solutions of increasing complexity, and implement/manage those solutions within your business. Learn from industry experts who bring real software automation into your classroom through hands-on learning. Also enjoy access to UiPath materials, software, and certifications through George Brown College Continuing Education's membership in the UiPath Academic Alliance.

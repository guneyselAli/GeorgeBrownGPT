In the event that an attacker is in the same building as you, determine if the door of the classroom or office you are in can be secured and if so, secure the door. If the door cannot be secured, determine if you can safely move to a classroom or office which can be secured. If you can safely evacuate/exit the building without being seen, then do so. If you have successfully secured yourself, cover all windows which may allow sight into the classroom or office. Account for everyone in the room. Turn the lights off and lie on the floor.
If possible contact Campus Security at: 416-415-4000 or dial "0" from a George Brown College internal Cisco phone.​

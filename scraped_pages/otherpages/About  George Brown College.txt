Our approach to supporting the GBC community is based on our newly launched Career Development Model, which is a new way of looking at career advancement based on how we Reflect, Discover, Connect, Create and Develop. We're committed to supporting our students and grads wherever they may be in their career journey.

The Career Development Model (CDM) promotes career growth and discovery within the context of George Brownâ€™s Human Skills Framework (HSF). As individuals engage with the 4 career themes, the HSF provides the lens of growth-mindset, life-long learning, and equity & anti-racism.

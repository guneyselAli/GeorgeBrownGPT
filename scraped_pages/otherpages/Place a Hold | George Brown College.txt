Changes to our LLC Laptop Loan Policy as of December 18, 2023; visit Library News & Services to read more.
You can request to have a library book put on hold for you and you will be notified when the item becomes available. Please note that you cannot place holds on tech equipment, reserve items (i.e. 3-hour loans), journals, magazines, videos, or DVDs.
You must be logged into your library account to place a hold. This is how the system knows who the item is for. You can either log in first and then search the library catalogue, or if you find your item first, you'll then be asked to log in.
When your hold is ready for pick-up, you will be contacted; email notices will be sent to your GBC email account. Be sure to check regularly for a pickup notice. Items will be held at the Circulation/Help Desk at the campus that you chose for pickup for 7 days.

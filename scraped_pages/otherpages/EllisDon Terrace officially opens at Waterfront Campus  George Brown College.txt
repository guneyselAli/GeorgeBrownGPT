EllisDon employees and George Brown College officials unveiled the EllisDon Terrace May 18th at a reception at the Waterfront Campus. The naming was in recognition of a $250,000 donation towards George Brownâ€™s Success at Work campaign earmarked for capital costs at the Centre for Health Sciences Waterfront Building. EllisDon managed construction of the building which opened to students last fall.
At the same event, Nona Heaslip and her late husband William were recognized for their $100,000 pledge to the campaign by naming the 7th floor lecture hall. Through their foundation they have been generous supporters of academia and health causes across Canada and in Toronto.

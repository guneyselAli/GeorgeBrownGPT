Please use caution when using Virtual Reality equipment.
VR technology may provoke unwanted side effects in users, but it's important to note that not everyone will experience side effects.
Moderation, taking breaks, and following best practices for VR use can help mitigate the potential negative effects. If you experience persistent discomfort or adverse effects, it's a good idea to consult a medical professional.
Please be aware of the following:
Motion Sickness: VR can cause motion sickness, especially when there's a disconnect between what the eyes see and what the inner ear perceives.
Nausea: Similar to motion sickness, some users may experience nausea or discomfort due to the conflicting sensory signals received by the brain.
Eye Strain: Prolonged use of VR can lead to eye strain, as the eyes may need to focus on screens at a close distance for extended periods.
Visual Fatigue: Staring at a VR screen for too long can result in visual fatigue and discomfort, similar to staring at a computer screen for extended periods.
Disorientation: After using VR, some individuals might experience a temporary sense of disorientation, where the real world feels strange or distant.
Dizziness: Rapid movements and changes in perspective in VR environments can lead to dizziness or a feeling of being off-balance.
Aggravation of Pre-existing Conditions: Individuals with pre-existing conditions such as epilepsy, certain heart conditions, or psychological disorders may find that VR exacerbates their symptoms.
Decreased Spatial Awareness: Prolonged VR use might affect an individual's sense of real-world spatial awareness once they remove the headset.
Skin Irritation: Wearing a VR headset for prolonged periods may lead to skin irritation, pressure sores, or discomfort on the face.

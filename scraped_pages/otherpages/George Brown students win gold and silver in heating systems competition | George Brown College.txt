Congratulations to Owen Buckley and Ryan Sutherland who represented George Brown College at the HRAI Heating System Technician Competition, taking home gold and silver respectively. 
The competition happened at the Canadian Mechanical and Plumbing Exposition at the Metro Convention Centre on March 24, where Owen and Ryan, students in the Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning program, showed off their skills during the Heating Systems Gauntlet, which features hands-on practical challenges. 
“Owen and Ryan, as well as fellow competitor Brandon Sisco, did an amazing job representing George Brown College,” said Professor Steven Racey. “Their impressive performances reflect the care and high-quality training we provide in this program.” 
And we’d like to give a shout-out to Haris Rahmati, who trained with Owen, Ryan and Brandon, but was unable to attend the competition.

This fall, the crest of the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, along with the medallion of our Indigenous Initiatives team, will proudly be displayed next to the George Brown College logo on all campus doors. This initiative is tied to creating a more visible Indigenous presence on campus, which is one of the commitments laid out in a recently signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
The next step for on-campus visibility will be to create and display full Land Acknowledgement decals. This is in addition to other commitments within the MOU, including working together on innovative access programming, co-creating curriculum and bringing Indigenous guest speakers into the classroom.
The Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation is part of the Ojibwe (Anishinaabe) Nation, one of North America's largest Aboriginal nations. Our three campuses sit on treaty Mississauga land.
By signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU), a new partnership was formed between George Brown College and the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation to bring important changes to our campuses.
The Indigenous land acknowledgment is a statement made at the beginning of George Brown College events to recognize the traditional territory upon which we are situated.Â

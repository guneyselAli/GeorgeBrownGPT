The students will broadcast these live performances via YouTube in June 2021. In lieu of admission fees for their performances, the students, staff and faculty of the School of Media and the Performing Arts hope that you will donate to the COVID-19 Student Emergency Relief Fund. This fund supports students studying at George Brown College who have experienced financial hardships because of the pandemic. 100% of your donation will go to the fund.
Donors will receive by email a tax receipt for the full amount of the donation of $20 or more. For more information about making a donation or other ways to support our students, please reach out to Gabriella Goutam at the George Brown College Foundation at gabriella.goutam@georgebrown.ca or 416-415-5000 ext. 3289. Should you have any questions about the Love and Information play, please contact Cindy Bautista at Cindy.Bautista@georgebrown.ca.
Thank you for your support.

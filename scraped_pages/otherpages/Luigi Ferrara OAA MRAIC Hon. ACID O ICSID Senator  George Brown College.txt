Luigi Ferrara is an architect, designer, educator and storyteller. He is the Dean of the Centre for Arts, Design & Information Technology at George Brown College in Toronto, Canada and Director of the internationally acclaimed Institute without Boundaries (IwB). He has served as President and Senator of ICSID (now called the World Design Organization [WDO]) and lectures around the world on topics as diverse as design and sustainability, design management, urban planning, information technology, digital media, telecommunications and the Wisdom Economy. 
In addition to running the Centre for Arts, Design & Information Technology, Luigi also advises the College’s Senior Management Team on Academic Space Planning. His background as an architect serves the College community as it continues to expand its current infrastructure. The College’s newest addition will open in September 2018 in the heart of the Toronto Waterfront when the new School of Design opens at the Daniels City of the Arts development site. Luigi is also playing a key role in the College’s next exciting venture – the opening of The Arbour the province’s first Tall Wood institutional building. The planned 12-storey, carbon-neutral facility will become a new landmark at our Waterfront Campus, where it will be located just north of the Daphne Cockwell Centre for Health Sciences across the street from the new School of Design.

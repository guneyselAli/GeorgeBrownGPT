Trudeau created a wave of excitement at the Centre for Construction and Engineering Technologies on March 23, where students lined the halls for a chance to shake hands and take a picture with the PM. He met with students from the Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) and Building Renovation Technician programs as he checked out the carpentry shop and our building information modeling (BIM) lab. BIM technology allows students, faculty and industry partners to create digital 3D models of buildings.

The prime minister's visit came the day after his government unveiled the 2017 federal budget. The remarks Trudeau delivered to the media gathered at the campus following his tour touched on his support for lifelong learning, including making Canada student loans and grants more accessible.
George Brown College President Anne Sado spoke to the focus on innovation and skills development.
"I appreciate the recognition that the nature of work is changing and the various approaches that can help bridge the developing gaps. I think key takeaways are the opportunities of collaboration and simplification," Sado said. "Our sector – colleges and polytechnics – are ready to not only play our part, but help drive the opportunities to positive implementation."

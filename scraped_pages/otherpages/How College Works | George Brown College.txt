Join us for this quick and informative session on learning to navigate the college environment, and meet some of your peers and student ambassadors. It can be challenging to figure out where to go and who to connect with but knowing how to navigate is critical to your academic, personal, and career success.
We'll cover what George Brown looks like, it's academic centres and schools, and who to reach out to for support with your academic teams and service areas. We'll chat about your course outlines, and what you can do to ensure your success. We'll follow with time for some questions and answers.Â

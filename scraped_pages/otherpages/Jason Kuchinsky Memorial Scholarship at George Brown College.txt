Jason Kuchinsky came to George Brown College School of Culinary Arts in 2012 with a dream. 
He was going to become a world class chef. He committed himself to learn and grow, to one day open his own restaurant with a menu and ambiance that would reflect his unique creative spirit. That vision was tragically erased – for him. His wish would have been to facilitate that journey for others. He would have wanted to inspire deserving new students to achieve a similar life goal.
We proudly open the Jason Kuchinsky Scholarship Fund in his memory.

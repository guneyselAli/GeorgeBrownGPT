New work-integrated learning (WIL) opportunities are available to students thanks to a partnership with the Business Higher Education Roundtable, or BHER. More than 700 students will get real-world experiences because of this joint effort.  
Indigenous and racialized students and students with disabilities will be prioritized for the 750 WIL opportunities throughout the 2021-2022 academic year. 
George Brown received $190,000 in funding from BHER with support from the Government of Canada and RBC Future Launch to provide these opportunities that could include any of the following: 
“Our partnership with BHER is vital as we continue to provide meaningful work-integrated learning experiences for all students, particularly those from underrepresented groups,” said Dario Guescini, George Brown College’s Director of Work-Integrated Learning, Experiential Education and Global Mobility. “These experiences provide important real-world experience and opportunities for students to build their professional networks.” 
BHER is a not-for-profit organization comprised of representatives from the Canadian business community as well as leading post-secondary institutions.  
“We are thrilled to help employers and students connect and develop innovative solutions for the evolving skills and talent challenges of Canada’s economy,” said BHER CEO Dr. Valerie Walker.

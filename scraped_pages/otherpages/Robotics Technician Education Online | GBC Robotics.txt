Our Robotics Technician certificate program provides a technical education so that you can expand your training in robotics. It gives you practical knowledge and skills you can take to work and apply right away.
The Robotics Certificate program provides a basic foundation of industrial robotics and how they can be used in a plant or manufacturing system. RoboLogix, the simulation software integrated within the program, emulates real-world robotics applications, allowing you to gain robot programming training. It employs the basic principles common to the vast majority of robots currently in use in the automation industry including Cartesian and SCARA designs.

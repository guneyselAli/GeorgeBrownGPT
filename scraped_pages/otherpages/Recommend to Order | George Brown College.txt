Faculty and students (or Library users) may place requests for the purchase of collection materials by completing the form provided below.
Please note that requests for an item do not guarantee its purchase. All suggested items are sent to the program-specific Liaison Librarian, and the same selection criteria are applied to requested items as with all other materials purchased by the Library, as stated in theÂ GBC Collection Development Policy.
Although recommendations are encouraged, final responsibility for the selection of library resources remains with the Liaison Librarian. Please contact your Liaison Librarian directly if you have any questions.
Please make one request per submission and fill in as many fields as possible.

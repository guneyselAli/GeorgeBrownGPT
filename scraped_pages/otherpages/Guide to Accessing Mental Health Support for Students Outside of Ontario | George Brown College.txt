Due to professional restrictions, GBC Counselling Services can only offer mental health counselling to students who are currently located in the province of Ontario. However, there are other free, professional mental health counselling resources offered to students outside of Ontario as listed below. If your concern is mainly an academic issue, please contact your department, or us at letstalk@georgebrown.ca. 
If you are looking for urgent support because of an imminent threat of harm to yourself or someone else, we strongly encourage you to contact emergency services local to your area. 
We encourage you to try the free 24/7 multi-lingual counselling services provided by: We Connect (services can be offered online via video, telephone, or in-person by a counsellor in your area).  In North America students can call the WeConnect Intake line (1-888-377-0002) to initiate services. The phone number which can be used from outside of North America is:  289-301-2580. 
If you are traveling overseas for a GBC field placement and require crisis or emergency services, International SOS (ISOS) can connect you with local services through the ISOS app. You can also call the GBC Emergency phone line at 416-415-4000. Please refer to the package provided by the Global Partnerships Office with more information regarding how to access these services and what to do in an Emergency.

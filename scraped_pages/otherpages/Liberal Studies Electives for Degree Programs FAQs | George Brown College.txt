Register for your program courses. Once you have your timetable, fill out one of the forms under Electives Registration, section C.
Note: There may be an additional fee to take the course if you are taking it out of sequence. The registration date for out-of-sequence electives is delayed and is not at the same time as web registration.
If you have completed General Education or Liberal Studies courses at another post-secondary institution and you earned a grade of 60% or higher, you might be eligible for exemption from one or more of your electives.

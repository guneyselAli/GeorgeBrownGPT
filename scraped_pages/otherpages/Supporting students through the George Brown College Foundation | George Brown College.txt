The Foundation is an incorporated, registered charity dedicated to providing opportunities for George Brown College students by raising funds for scholarships and bursaries, capital projects and programming. We achieve this with the help and support of our generous partners and donors.
The Foundation and college’s partners contribute in so many ways. From hiring grads to providing mentorship, they are a big part of the College. The financial contributions from partners make it easier for our students to pay for education, and in turn, realize their potential.
The Foundation also raises funds for capital projects that support the college’s strategy and vision. Through our Success at Work campaign, we have contributed to construction of the Daphne Cockwell Centre for Health Sciences and relocation of the School of Design to the Daniels Waterfront City of the Arts development.
Your support will foster a positive ripple effect in the wider community: a student becomes a workplace-ready graduate, an employer fills a critical need, and an individual develops confidence, job skills and knowledge to last a lifetime.
There are a variety of ways for partners and donors to support George Brown College and our students. Whether you’re looking to make a one-time donation or make your contributions on-going, we have flexible options for you to consider.

Pay with Aeroplan® Miles through the HigherEdPoints.com program
George Brown College is now partnered with the HigherEdPoints.com program which allows students, family members, and friends to redeem their Aeroplan® miles to pay for their education at George Brown College.
Through this program, Aeroplan® members can redeem their miles and convert them in $250 increments to offset the cost of college. (35,000 Aeroplan® Miles = $250)
Once the transfer is received from HigherEdPoints.com, it will appear on your student account at GBC within 2-3 business days as a non-refundable cash deposit.
Please note: You can only convert Aeroplan® Miles online through HigherEdPoints.com, not at the front counter or via the other payment options.
For further details, please visit the HigherEdPoints website

If you are a family living in Toronto, you know how important it is to have access to high quality child care. As part of our early education career training, George Brown operates 12 innovative child care centres in a variety of facilities across Toronto.
Staffed by fully trained early childhood educators, the child care centres play an important role as lab schools, helping students develop their skills, and as crucial sources of high quality daycare for you and your child.
Tour one of our child care labs, a pre-school/kindergarten playground and an infant/toddler playground online through our virtual tour.
The centres are collaborations with the Baycrest Geriatric Centre, Oxford Properties, and the Toronto District School Board and the following:

George Brown’s General Arts and Science - English for Academic Purposes (EAP) program offers 9 levels of full-time English instruction. Each level is 8 weeks long. Upon registration, students take a Level Placement Test to see which level they should start in. Students then progress through the levels, adding to their reading, writing, listening, speaking and grammar skills.
Important Notice about EAP Program Schedule
The EAP program runs from 9am to 5pm daily, with classes on two schedules: the morning schedule is 9am to 1pm and the afternoon schedule is 1pm to 5pm. The School of ESL is unable to accommodate students’ schedule change requests or preferences.
Level 7 and 8 students may choose the Post-secondary studies, Business, or Hospitality stream in preparation for their future studies*.
*Space is limited in each option.

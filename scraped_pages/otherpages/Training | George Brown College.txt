At George Brown College, we're committed to ensuring employees have access to training/tools and resources that support racially responsive and culturally sensitive practice with a focus on inclusive and accessible language, power and privilege, and racial trauma.
While we continue to develop training opportunities, we encourage you to visit some of our resources:
The Ontario Human Rights Commission has developed an online training called “Call it Out.” The training is a 30-minute interactive eCourse that offers a foundation for learning about race, racial discrimination and human rights protections under the Ontario Human Rights Code.
This is a two-day group activity that brings visual creativity and deep self-reflection together. Participants reflect on their racial and cultural identity with a view towards creating a personal collage. By way of understanding one’s positionality and identity, participants begin to reflect on how their understanding of self informs their understanding of others.
Note: This activity will be conducted over the course of two days, each day consisting of a single 2 ½ hours session. It is best suited for groups of 5-8 participants. This is activity is a team-building activity that focuses on racial identity and culture awareness.

Trade Up! Find your passion in the Skilled Trades.
As one of Ontario’s leading providers of apprenticeship and skilled trades training, we can help you determine which trade is the right fit for you. We offer two pathways to the trades. If you’re not ready to become an apprentice, you can choose a post-secondary trades-related program. This route will help you learn more about a trade and you’ll graduate with an Ontario College Credential. If you know an apprenticeship is for you, as a Training Delivery Agent, we offer the in-school educational components for several apprenticeship programs.
Our programs prepare you to become a work-place ready graduate. You’ll learn under expert faculty in labs and studios that provide industry-standard technology and equipment. And our partnerships with employers and government ensure you’re always learning established industry standards and requirements.
Our Entry Advising service is a free service provided by the college to help match your skills, background and career goals with program options.
Attend an information session to learn more about our programs and have your questions answered by our knowledgeable faculty and staff. 
Our tour guides will show you around our classrooms, labs and facilities, and give you an idea of what to expect from student life at George Brown.

The George Brown College community is buzzing after three of our recent graduates won an international construction management competition.
Doan (Lucas) Dang, Nick Lourenco, and Mike Lino won the top prize at the Chartered Institute of Building's Global Student Challenge , beating out 53 teams from universities around the world. The GBC trio was the only college team and the only group from North America to make it to the final six. 
Dang, Lourenco and Lino accepted their award at a ceremony in Toronto on July 12 as part of the CIOB 2018 Members Forum. 
In the challenge, students use MERIT simulation software to run a virtual construction company and bid on projects against competitors. This simulation incorporates areas such as financing, human resources, bidding, project management and marketing. MERIT simulation is part of the curriculum in the Bachelor of Technology (Construction Management) program. 
Dang, Lourenco and Lino were mentored by Andrew Gordon, a professor at the Angelo Del Zotto School of Construction Management, a construction management consultant and a CIOB Fellow.

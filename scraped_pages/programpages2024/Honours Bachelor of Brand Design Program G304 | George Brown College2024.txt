Full Description
The
Honours Bachelor of Brand Design
is a four-year degree program that responds to the rapidly changing world of graphic design by preparing you to be a forward-looking brand designer.
Brands are more than logos or sales tactics––they're strategic relationships between the brand makers and audiences. A brand is a promise to follow through on its mission and values. It's the thoughts and feelings that arise when someone thinks about a company or product.

Convey a brand's identity through visual and physical designs across various online and offline platforms.
Research and design adaptable brand experiences that engage customers across different touchpoints.
Articulate a brand's story, connecting with audiences through various mediums.
Foster innovative collaboration within diverse teams.
This program will teach you to:
Craft clear brand messages for various platforms that engage audiences.
Grasp new technology and navigate both traditional and modern channels.
Write effectively for different scenarios, audiences, and styles.
Adapt readily to changing work environments and sectors.
Collaborate effectively, bridging business and creative aspects of branding.
Employ varied research methods in the design process.
Provide diverse and customizable services, including specialized areas like video and animation.
Compete professionally in sales pitches with competitive pricing.

The work term allows students to apply the skills, abilities and knowledge they've acquired in the program in a workplace environment or through an appropriate interaction design research project or initiative. Students gain valuable experience and the opportunity to reflect on the application of previous learning. A faculty member evaluates the student based on feedback provided by the employer.

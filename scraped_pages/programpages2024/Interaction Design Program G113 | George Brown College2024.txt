Program Overview
The three-year
Interaction Design
advanced diploma program will introduce you to the interdisciplinary field of interaction design, which merges design skills like user experience, interface development, and graphic design with coding fundamentals. Learn the art of crafting meaningful experiences between users and digital platforms like social media, websites, wearables, and mobile devices.
Full Description
The field of interaction design is always changing based on psychological, social, economic, and cultural factors that shape our world. And as the world changes, designers imagine new ways to interact with computers within systems, services, products, and spaces, to elevate the user experience.

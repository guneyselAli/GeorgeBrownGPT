Program Description
Program Overview
This 2-year program is eligible for
a $40,000 scholarship.
*
In the
Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Technician
diploma program, you'll develop the ability to size, install, and maintain building environmental systems for the residential and light commercial sectors.

*Domestic students only – see page for details.
Full Description
Rising fuel costs, indoor air quality, and climate change are all contributing factors in raising awareness of the true cost of energy. There is a great need for energy-efficient building environmental system design, construction, and maintenance.
In the
Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Technician
two-year diploma program, you will:
Develop the ability to size, install, and maintain building environmental systems for the residential and light commercial sectors.
Gain solid skills and knowledge in the design, operation, and maintenance of environmental systems in heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC/R).
Develop practical skills through hands-on experience, working on a wide range of furnaces, air conditioners, refrigeration equipment, and other appliances in our labs.
Gain competency with industry-ready skills in soldering, wiring, and electric control circuitry and troubleshooting for HVAC and gas installations.
Use computer-aided design software to assess building heating and cooling requirements, select equipment, and develop HVAC system drawings and specifications for the residential market.
The program follows industry-standard design practices for environmentally responsible and energy-efficient residential, commercial, and industrial systems, as established by the Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Institute (HRAI), the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and the Canada Green Building Council.
Note:
When you enrol in the program in January, you must complete semester 2 in the summer (May to August) of the same year in order to continue into semester 3 in the fall.
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
As a graduate of this diploma program, you'll be prepared for a range of positions in the HVAC field. Technicians install, maintain, and repair heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration systems for commercial and residential buildings. Other employment opportunities include sales, system balancing, and cost-estimating for projects. Experienced technicians may also explore self-employment in the gas heating industry after obtaining a Gas Fitter 2 certification.
You will also have sufficient training to challenge the Gas Fitter 2 provincial qualification exam** and if successful (75 per cent passing grade) obtain the Gas Fitter 2 certification.
As well, for the course Building Code for HVAC (HVAC 2014) delivered in semester 3, we assist students in preparing to challenge the Ontario Ministry of Consumer Affairs and Housing HVAC House exam.* Individuals who are successful (75 per cent passing grade) can use this qualification toward obtaining their "Building Code Identification Number" (BCIN).**
*Please note that in addition to passing the HVAC House exam, there are further requirements to qualify for a Building Code Identification Number. For more information on the Building Code Identification Number, please visit the
Ontario Building Code website
.
**The above-mentioned qualification exams are administered by the Province of Ontario. George Brown College is not responsible for the administration and/or marking of these exams.

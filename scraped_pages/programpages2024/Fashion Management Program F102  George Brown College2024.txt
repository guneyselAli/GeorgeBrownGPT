"George Brown College in Toronto (Canada) gave me a great education through its excellent program and enthusiastic professors and staff! After 2 years and 28 Fashion Management courses I am confident to join the fashion community and build my career in Toronto.
As an international student I was worried about my communication skills and lack of a network here because of language barriers and cultural differences, but the staff helped me in finding internships and they taught me how to write a resume and succeed in interviews (which I think is essential for everyone!). The program was practical and helpful in developing my career plan.
In addition, my professors and peers are amazing people. I learned a lot from them about cooperating in teams and producing Threads, our year-end event, and fashion shows. I had many opportunities to meet and work with designers, friends, and other creatives in Toronto.
Moreover, we have strong alumni ties which are super-beneficial for us to find better opportunities and help the next generation to grow together. I LOVE MY CLASS OF 2022!!!! "

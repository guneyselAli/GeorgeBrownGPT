Program Overview
The
Hearing Instrument Specialist
program will teach you the specialized skills required to work as a hearing health care professional. You will develop people skills and will learn how to use the latest technology to assess appropriate hearing solutions for those in need. For applicants with a relevant degree or diploma, we offer an opportunity for advanced standing into semester 3 of the program.
Full Description
The
Hearing Instrument Specialist (S117)
three-year advanced diploma program will teach you the clinical, technical and people skills you need to work as part of an interprofessional hearing health care team.
Hearing aids have evolved dramatically in recent years. Now smaller and more sophisticated in terms of capability, high-end devices leverage the latest technology and provide a superior hearing experience. If you like to work with technology and people, this is an exciting time to work as a hearing instrument specialist.
As hearing is a vital communication tool that helps us interact with others and our environment, hearing instrument specialists play an important role in helping deliver solutions to those diagnosed with hearing loss.
While hearing loss is not exclusive to older adults, it does often occur with age. With Canada's aging population, the demand for
highly qualified hearing instrument specialists
who can provide a
client-centred approach
to better hearing health care will continue to increase in the coming years.
In this program, you'll study the hearing instrument sciences to build a strong foundation in the theory and skills related to:
acoustics
audiometric testing
selection and fitting of hearing aids
hearing aid technology
You will develop clinical skills to
test and assess hearing
and
learn how to select and fit hearing aids.
You will also develop the soft skills, or people skills, needed to work with a range of clients with varying degrees of hearing loss. Skills like active listening, empathy and effective communication will help you learn how to connect with your clients and better understand their unique needs to provide exceptional client-based care.
You'll also be encouraged to develop an entrepreneurial mindset through additional courses that address key contemporary topics, including:
clinic management
health promotion
counselling
Earn this Advanced Diploma in Two Years with an Existing Credential
Applicants who have successfully completed a bachelorâ€™s degree or a diploma in health sciences, social sciences, or a related field, with an overall average of B minus (or 2.7 GPA or 70 per cent) may be considered for advanced standing into semester 3 of the program.
Your Field Education Options
Field placement is a key component of this Hearing Instrument Specialist program, as it will allow you to apply what you've learned in the classroom to the work you will do with real patients.
This program offers both an internal and an external placement during semester 6.
Initially, you will participate in a 21-hour placement at our on-site state-of-the-art
WAVE Hearing Clinic (Hearing Clinic IV
). During this time, you will practise treating members of the public, including George Brown students, by performing the day-to-day tasks of a hearing instrument specialist (e.g., testing hearing, fitting hearing aids and providing client counselling).
In the second half of the final semester, you will work off-site with a community partner for seven weeks (equivalent to 245 clinic hours) and will once again perform the day-to-day tasks of a hearing instrument specialist.
PLEASE NOTE:
As a student in this program, you will be responsible for finding your own field experience opportunities. You will be supported in this process by program faculty.
External field education generally occurs in the broader Greater Toronto Area, so travel will be required. You should be aware that field education opportunities may be located anywhere within the province, especially if suitable opportunities cannot be found in Toronto and surrounding areas. You will be responsible for travel and other associated costs related to external field education opportunities.
Are you interested in this program but need more competitive marks? Consider enrolling in the
Pre-Health Sciences Pathway to Advanced Diplomas and Degrees (A108) program
. This program will help you develop new and strengthen existing skills in math, biology, chemistry, physics and communication.
PLEASE NOTE: While successful graduates of the (A108) program will be eligible to apply to this advanced diploma, it does not guarantee entry into this program.
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
Hearing Instrument Specialist program faculty have strong partnerships with industry and professional associations so that they can fully prepare graduates for employment.
The employment rate continues to be high in related career sectors, including:
clinical
manufacturing
training
self-employment
In Ontario, hearing aids may only be dispensed by prescription from a professional authorized by the Regulated Health Professions Act.
Hearing Instrument Specialist graduates are eligible for full membership in the
Association of Hearing Instrument Practitioners of Ontario (AHIP)
as a hearing instrument dispenser (HID); annual dues are paid to maintain membership in AHIP. Typically, graduates enrol in the Hearing Instrument Specialist (HIS) internship program and successfully complete 1,000 hours of practical work within 36 months of graduation. In addition, graduates must successfully complete the international licensing exam within the time period in order to become full hearing instrument specialist members of AHIP.

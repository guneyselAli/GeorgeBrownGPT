Full Description

Community Worker (Accelerated) (C131)
diploma program, designed for college and university graduates, is a dynamic, fast-track program grounded in the principles of and respect for social justice, human rights and anti-oppressive practice.
If you are passionate about human rights and social justice, committed to working with diverse communities, bring a mature and professional approach to your education and fieldwork, and are prepared to take on a full-time course load, this program is for you.

You will learn to work with urban-centred, diverse communities across a range of issues, including poverty, housing, food justice, immigration, and settlement, and develop the skills you need to be responsive to community needs as they change and evolve.

Special Requirements
Vulnerable Sector Check requirements and program policy
Note:
In compliance with the requirements of our field partners, all students in this program are encouraged to complete a Police Vulnerable Sector Check before commencing their field placement. These reference checks, which can take up to four months, are done to protect the clientele of these agencies who are considered “vulnerable persons” under the law. The fees for the reference checks vary by region and must be paid by the student. Students are responsible for ensuring that the Police Vulnerable Sector Check covers appropriateness for “individuals being employed and/or volunteering who will be working with vulnerable person(s).” The program will assist students in applying for the police check once they begin the program.
Students without a clear police reference check may find that their choice of placement is limited. Students in this situation are encouraged to work with the field education coordinator to identify placement opportunities that do not require the vulnerable sector check. Students are also encouraged to inquire and apply for Suppression and Destruction of Record or Record Suspension (formerly known as Pardon) at their specific regional police services in order to prepare for their future careers or employment.

Clinical Pre-placement website

“As someone with previous post-secondary education, enrolling in the Community Worker Fast track program was the best choice I could have made. The programs’ professors are experienced academics and passionate advocates for community work and the diverse professional and educational backgrounds of my classmates created a unique and enhanced educational experience. The title “Community Worker” gives you the freedom and option of tailoring your professional goals at your co-op placement into work that you're passionate about. George Brown has been the best post-secondary experience.”

"The fashion business industry program applied a multidisciplinary approach that prepared students for independence in the fashion industry. It was through this combined approach that students learned the intricacies of business and fashion in order to effectively manage, design and implement their ideas in the field. The professors and community are enthusiastic and encourage growth within the fashion and jewelry arts programs. Through a combination of awards, contests, research projects, and events, every student is provided ample opportunity to demonstrate their individuality within the supportive community at GBC."

George Brown certainly made me feel very welcome coming from a different background. Every time I visit the students' centre, every time I talk to different professors or people at the school, they always make sure that I feel supported. As a recruiter now, I often go to different colleges, universities, and different job fairs. Last year we hired a George Brown graduate. This year we are in the process of hiring three more George Brown graduates. This program will not just prepare you for a job in a bank or a stock brokerage firm, it'll just give you so much more.

Program Description
Program Overview
The one-year
Information Systems Business Analysis
graduate certificate program answers the urgent need for professionals who can help bridge the gap between business and information technology functions within an organization. As a proud Academic Member of the International Institute of Business Analysis, we'll prepare you to write the Entry Certificate in Business Analysis™.
If you're an IT or business professional wanting to enter a business analyst role, or a practitioner who wants to enhance your skill-set with formal education, this intensive program is for you.
Full Description
Over the past decade, information technology has exploded in businesses, pushing business analysts and IT consultants into the spotlight across sectors like government, finance, healthcare, and telecommunications. These professionals are key players in software development, collecting business needs and turning them into technical plans that IT teams can execute. These analysts and IT consultants are often critical for boosting project success rates.
In the one-year
Information Systems Business Analysis
graduate certificate program, you'll develop a deeper understanding of the business analyst role through unique learning techniques and invaluable practical experience. Our team of business analyst consultants and faculty will support you as you develop critical skills and competencies in the areas of:
problem identification
documenting and analyzing user requirements
process and workflow modelling
communication and facilitation
project management
technical writing
leadership and management
decision-making
A key characteristic of this program is the applied nature of the curriculum. You'll be immersed in the process of business analysis through case studies of real-world business issues, which you'll use to develop innovative solutions. Our program stands out by offering applied, hands-on experience, transforming you into an actual business analyst, rather than just someone who knows how to do it.
Delivery
This full-time program is delivered in a blended format, combining face-to-face sessions with online delivery.
You will generally meet late afternoons, evenings, and weekends. This delivery format accommodates those who wish to work while taking this program.

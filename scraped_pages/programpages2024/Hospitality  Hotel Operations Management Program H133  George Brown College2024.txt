Program Description
Program Overview
Do you want to work in the vibrant global hotel and hospitality industry? Gain the knowledge and skills to launch a successful career with the
Hospitality – Hotel Operations Management
program.
Full Description
The two-year
Hospitality – Hotel Operations Management (H133)
diploma program prepares graduates for exciting careers in the hotel industry and other areas such as restaurants, convention centres, luxury retirement homes, entertainment complexes and more. You'll study in downtown Toronto, surrounded by leading hospitality organizations.
You will learn about current and best practices in the following areas:
front office
food and beverage
marketing and sales
conferences and event planning
retirement homes
branded residences
country clubs
You will start building your professional network and resume by completing a 14-week work-integrated learning experience with your choice of a Canadian or international placement. And a hotel operations management simulation—part of a final capstone project—gives you the opportunity to show off your skills. Students can also participate in a European study tour, visiting top hotels.
This program allows you to switch to any of our hospitality and tourism management diploma programs by your second year should your hospitality area of interest change. We know life can be full of unexpected events; should you not be able to complete your final year of study, our common first-year model makes you eligible to graduate with a one-year certificate in
Hospitality Services (H101)
.
Your Field Education Options
As part of your fourth semester, you will complete a 14-week industry externship with your choice of a Canadian or international placement. This opportunity will enhance your knowledge with real-world experience and help you start building your network of contacts. The Hotel Operations Management program will make you the kind of multi-talented graduate the local and international hotel industry seeks in today’s competitive environment.
Students gain the skills required to be progressive leaders within the industry, enriching the experience of hotel guests. You will receive industry certifications in food safety, responsible alcohol beverage service and first aid (CPR).
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
With more than 38,000 hotel rooms and over 200 hotels in the Toronto area and counting, employment opportunities abound. Many of our graduates now work in supervisory and management positions in major hotels nationwide and internationally, while some have reached high-level corporate positions in large hotel chains. You can also explore a wealth of management career opportunities in restaurants, casinos, luxury retirement homes, cruise ships, convention centers, entertainment complexes, clubs, bed and breakfasts, catering companies and conference services.
Educational Pathways
Earn a diploma and a bachelor’s degree. Qualified graduates of our Hospitality – Hotel Operations Management program may be eligible to enter the
Honours Bachelor of Business Administration (Hospitality)
degree program at George Brown College as an advanced standing student in September or January. You may also choose to start in the spring bridging semester from May to August, continuing into the degree program in September.

Program Description
Program Overview
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS
This online distance program is only available to study while remaining in your home country and
does not qualify for study/work permit eligibility in Canada.
The Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) Technician Certificate program provides the basic technical skills and knowledge necessary to work with programmable logic control systems typically found in an industrial/manufacturing environment. The program covers the operation of various PLC control systems, including both discrete and analog control devices. The simulation software, PLCLogix 500, which is included with the program, simulates the Rockwell RSLogix 500 series of PLCs.
ADVANCED STANDING
If you have finished the PLC Technician II program, you are exempted from 7 modules of the PLC Technician program.
Full Description
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS
This online distance program is only available to study while remaining in your home country and
does not qualify for study/work permit eligibility in Canada.
The PLC Technician Certificate program provides a basic introduction to PLCs, focusing on the practical applications of PLCs in a plant or manufacturing system.
The learning materials, provided in a web-based downloadable file format with 19 courses (modules), contain text, audio, 2D and 3D animations, computer-based testing and PLCLogix 500 simulation software.
The interactive PLCLogix 500 simulation software essentially converts your computer into a virtual PLC and allows you to run, verify and debug ladder logic programs based on the Rockwell RSLogix 500 format. PLCLogix 500 allows you to familiarize yourself with many different features associated with Rockwell PLCs, including timers, counters, sequencers and math functions. Design ladder logic programs, perform tests and simulate the operation of real-world components, including motors, solenoid valves and a wide variety of other discrete and analog I/O devices. The simulation software includes over 250 pre-built lab projects and 11 manufacturing environments (3D worlds) that graphically simulate process control operations for the following applications: batch mixing, bottling line, dual-compressor, elevator, moving car wash, silo, single-compressor, stationary car wash, traffic lights, warehouse door, and valve.​
You may enrol at any time during the year (open enrolment) and complete the modules in the learning package at your own speed. The typical completion time is 32 weeks, but there are no time limits.

Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
This program prepares you to work in the rapidly expanding field of industrial automation and control. Automation in the industry is providing jobs for technically trained people who can build, program, integrate, service, maintain and operate PLCs. The PLC Technician program will provide the basic technical skills and knowledge necessary to work with electrical control systems typically found in an industrial environment.
PLC technicians install and repair industrial electronic equipment, including I/O networks, data highways, variable speed drives and process control equipment, and write PLC programs for a wide variety of automated control systems, ranging from simple on-off control systems to robotics. PLC technicians also find employment in the industrial engineering field, where they are actively involved in the design and implementation of PLC control systems.

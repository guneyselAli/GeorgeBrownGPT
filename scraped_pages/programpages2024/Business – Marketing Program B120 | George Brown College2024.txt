Educational Pathways
B120 graduates can easily transfer into two other Marketing programs at George Brown College: the three-year advanced diploma in Marketing and the four-year degree in Digital Marketing.
Transfer Option 1
: Direct pathway into the Business Administration-Marketing three-year advanced diploma program:  If you'd like to continue with more in-depth study of the marketing field, consider transferring into our three-year advanced diploma, which introduces you to more specialized topics such as international and digital marketing.
Transfer Option 2
: Direct pathway into the Honours Bachelor of Commerce - Digital Marketing four-year degree program: If you'd like to continue with more in-depth study of the marketing field, and earn both a diploma and a degree, consider transferring into our four-year degree, which focuses on digital marketing.
Transferring into the degree program requires a program GPA of 3.0 or higher, plus taking some "bridging courses" to catch up to students already in the degree.  This "2+2" transfer model — two years of diploma studies leading to two years of degree studies — is ideal for students who'd like to leverage their time at the college to earn both a diploma and a degree.

transfer guide

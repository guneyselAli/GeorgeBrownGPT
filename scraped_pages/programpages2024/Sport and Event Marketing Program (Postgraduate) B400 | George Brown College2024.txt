Program Description
Program Overview
The
Sport and Event Marketing
graduate certificate program provides students with the knowledge and skills employers seek in sports, arts and entertainment and not-for-profit marketing careers. Join like-minded students in downtown Toronto as you learn to examine and apply sport and event marketing best practices, strategies, tactics, tools, and techniques.
Full Description
For over 25 years, George Brown’s
Sport and Event Marketing
graduate certificate program has prepared students with a foundation in consumer marketing. In 12 months, students learn and develop creativity and critical thinking skills that transfer from the classroom to the boardroom. It is common for assignments and projects to involve industry partners, particularly in the final semester when students plan and run a charitable event.
The program covers sports, arts, and entertainment marketing, sponsorship activation, event planning, integrated marketing communications (IMC), digital marketing, non-profit marketing, and financial metrics. Students will also enjoy extracurricular opportunities like speed mentoring and attending the
5 to Watch: Canada’s Sports Business Awards
.
Here are some skills you’ll be able to show off after completion of the Sport and Event Marketing program:
Creating integrated marketing and media plans for the arts, entertainment, cause-related marketing, and sports sectors
Organizing and executing events using project management and team-building skills
Developing and evaluating sponsorship activation opportunities from the consumer, property, and buyer's perspective
Creating professional and persuasive presentations using industry-standard software

Centre for Business
program is part of our
School of Marketing

Your Field Education Options
Work Experience (co-op or internship work term)
This program requires the successful completion of one semester of work experience to graduate. This work experience is either co-op (paid) or internship (unpaid). Either one will give you the practical experience employers value.
The work term occurs after the end of the second academic semester.
George Brown works with employers and industry partners to identify potential work experience opportunities. Students then apply for these opportunities and go through a competitive interview process. Students are also strongly encouraged to pursue self-directed industry work experience opportunities they believe will provide the learning experiences they value and meet the learning outcomes of the program. This valuable work experience can, in turn, be added to your resumé.
In addition to on-the-job work experience, George Brown College endeavours to provide field education opportunities with real-world challenges and clients. Find out more about
field education
at the Centre for Business.

I was really looking for a way to pair my degree with a more applied postgraduate experience. I had a strong sports background after being at Queen’s, but I was missing the business side. I was lucky to be accepted into the Sport & Event Marketing program. If you want to work in sports, it’s definitely the best place in the country to be.

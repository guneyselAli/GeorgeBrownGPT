Full Description
The
Honours Bachelor of Brand Design
is a four-year degree program that responds to the rapidly changing world of graphic design by preparing you to be a forward-looking brand designer.
Brands are more than logos or sales tactics––they're strategic relationships between the brand makers and audiences. A brand is a promise to follow through on its mission and values. It's the thoughts and feelings that arise when someone thinks about a company or product.
Upon completing this program, you will:
Convey a brand's identity through visual and physical designs across various online and offline platforms.
Research and design adaptable brand experiences that engage customers across different touchpoints.
Articulate a brand's story, connecting with audiences through various mediums.
Foster innovative collaboration within diverse teams.
This program will teach you to:
Craft clear brand messages for various platforms that engage audiences.
Grasp new technology and navigate both traditional and modern channels.
Write effectively for different scenarios, audiences, and styles.
Adapt readily to changing work environments and sectors.
Collaborate effectively, bridging business and creative aspects of branding.
Employ varied research methods in the design process.
Provide diverse and customizable services, including specialized areas like video and animation.
Compete professionally in sales pitches with competitive pricing.
Advanced Entry Pathway:
Graduates and students currently in year two or three of George Brown College’s three-year
Graphic Design (G102)
advanced diploma may be eligible for advanced entry into the Honours Bachelor of Brand Design program. Following the winter semester (January–April), students who have successfully completed the second year of the George Brown College Graphic Design (G102) advanced diploma with a
GPA of 3.2 (75 per cent)
or higher, or have graduated from the program with a
GPA of 3.2 (75 per cent)
or higher, will be eligible to complete a summer bridge program. Upon successful completion of the bridge, students will enter into semester 5 of the degree program in the fall.
Program Structure
Option A:
Two years completed of Graphic Design+ Bridge (three courses + two Liberal Studies electives) + two years of Degree (18 courses plus 420 hours of co-op) = Honours Bachelor of Brand Design.
Option B:
Three years completed of Graphic Design+ Bridge (three courses + two liberal studies electives)+ two years of Degree (18 courses plus 420 hours of co-op) = Graphic Design advanced diploma PLUS Honours Bachelor of Brand Design.
Your Field Education Options
Students must complete a 420-hour paid co-op work term in the spring/summer period between the third and fourth year.
Students have the opportunity to complete this co-op domestically and/or internationally, as opportunities arise. The majority of co-op work terms are completed in the Greater Toronto Area, where the design sector is robust and the majority of interaction jobs are located.
The School of Design Field Placement team works with many notable training partners, including agencies such as Publicis, K9 Strategy + Design, Trevor/Peter and Relish Interactive; larger, well-known brands such as Nelvana (Corus Entertainment), Rogers Media, Mozilla, Crayola and PUR Gum; and a variety of industry-relevant arts and design institutions, including the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), the Association of Registered Graphic Designers (RGD) and Applied Arts.
The work term allows students to apply the skills, abilities and knowledge they've acquired in the program in a workplace environment or through an appropriate interaction design research project or initiative. Students gain valuable experience and the opportunity to reflect on the application of previous learning. A faculty member evaluates the student based on feedback provided by the employer.
Students will develop a digital portfolio demonstrating artifacts completed during the co-op work term.
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
Graduates of this program will have the skills needed for roles in design, branding and digital media studios, creative labs, in-house design, and digital departments within larger corporations across sectors. You'll also be ready to work independently, or as part of a start-up.

brand designer

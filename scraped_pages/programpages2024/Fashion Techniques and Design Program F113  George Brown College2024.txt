Program Description
Program Overview
The
Fashion Techniques and Design
two-year diploma program prepares you for an exciting career in garment-manufacturing design rooms. This is a women's wear program that focuses on pattern drafting and sewing skills. Using industrial machines, you'll learn the essentials of technical illustration, pattern making, pattern grading, and clothing construction. Additional core subjects include textiles, technical specifications, and history of costume.
Full Description
In the
Fashion Techniques and Design
two-year diploma program, you'll focus on women's wear in a learning environment that closely simulates the industry's standards, practices, and facilities. Program electives allow you to select specific related subject areas, such as fashion show development, portfolio development, draping, lingerie, men's pattern drafting, leather apparel, knitwear, and bridal and evening wear. We offer core and elective courses that keep up with industry trends, including Adobe Illustrator, pattern drafting, and pattern grading. In the second year, we'll introduce you to more advanced concepts.
You'll get to show off your work at our annual fashion show, and again at a special portfolio event. As part of the program, you'll also get the opportunity to network with industry professionals, participate in numerous competitions, work on applied research projects, volunteer, and attend industry events.
Note
: This program requires extensive sewing; manual dexterity and good vision are assets. Both sewing experience and access to a sewing machine outside of the campus facilities are expected. Students who begin the program in January will study through the spring/summer semester and continue into the September academic year.  For January students, the program is condensed to 1.5 years by studying through the spring/summer period.

"I am thankful for all the learning opportunities I have been given at FX and School of Fashion and Jewellery, George Brown College. I have been lucky to have such amazing teachers and mentors. Ula Zukowska was my Industrial Power Sewing instructor at FX and later taught me construction sewing at George Brown College in the Fashion Techniques and Design Program. Ula hired me upon graduating from the Fashion Techniques program and I am deeply grateful. I would also like to acknowledge Berta Pavlov who is the instructor of the PAD software certificate program who gave me the skills to become a technical designer in fashion. I am fortunate enough to be able to work at FX and be surrounded by experts and masters in the fashion industry and be able to help the team create such amazing new designs and products."

Program Overview
The
Computer Systems Technology
three-year advanced diploma program will give you what you need to meet the high demand for skilled employees in the tech industry. Designed with extensive input from our industry partners, this program offers two optional specializations in your third year of study. Plus, you'll get to work on exciting, hands-on projects developing IT solutions.
PLEASE NOTE:
This program is also offered in a fully online format. Please see
Computer System Technology (Online) program (T187)
for more details.
Full Description
The three-year
Computer Systems Technology
advanced diploma program is designed with extensive industry input and offers two optional specializations in its third year:
The Networking specialization
focuses on network security, voice-over-IP (VoIP), and wireless LANs.
The Systems specialization
focuses on mail server administration, content management systems (Collaboration), database administration, and computer security.
Both specializations include core courses on infrastructure virtualization (through the VMWare IT Academy) and cloud computing, along with best practices in Information Technology (IT).
In your third year, you'll also be involved in real-life projects or case studies. You can complete these independently, along with an industry partner or George Brown's Office of Research and Innovation. This hands-on experience may include working in teams to develop proposals, plan, set schedules, and achieve specific goals in information technology. Through some of these exciting projects, our students have helped develop IT solutions for hospitals, large corporations, and major IT and telecommunications service providers, including Bell Mobility, Rogers Communications, Cogeco Data Systems, and many other well-known companies in the GTA.
This program covers all courses of the official Cisco CCNA Routing & Switching curriculum. The curriculum also prepares students to write several other examinations leading to industry certifications, such as the Certified Wireless Network Administrator (CWNA) and Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate.
Our college continues to invest in up-to-date networking, wireless, radio frequency, VoIP, and security lab equipment, so that all students gain hands-on experience in installation and configuration of equipment ranging from small offices all the way to enterprise-class hardware and software. Cisco recognized this investment, along with the hands-on teaching environment, and designated George Brown as an Area Support Centre and Instructor Training Centre, making us part of a very select group of Cisco Networking Academies in Canada.
Note:
Students who start the program in January (winter term) will be required to attend classes during the summer months (May to August).
Technology Requirements
You'll need to have access to a personal computer with the following specifications:
16 GB RAM minimum
256 GB SSD Hard Drive (500+ GB is optimal)
Quad-core i7 2.4GHz or better
Video card (2GB RAM minimum/4GB RAM recommended)

Program Description
Leadership Claims
Preparing graduates to work as early childhood educators for more than 40 years.
Program Overview
Get ready for a rewarding career working with children from six weeks to 12 years of age in a variety of early childhood education settings with the
Early Childhood Education
diploma program.
Full Description
Gain the knowledge and practical experience needed to support children's learning as they grow with the two-year
Early Childhood Education (C100)
diploma
program. Study the developmental stages of infants (from six weeks), toddlers, preschoolers, and school-age children (to 12 years) and learn how to design educational programming and respond to a child's unique needs and interests.
You will also engage with families and the broader community.
This program alternates between in-class learning and field placement to help you develop confidence in your skills as you apply concepts from the classroom to a real-world setting. This approach prepares graduates to hit the ground running as soon as they enter the workforce.
Please note:
Some field placement partners may require students to show proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 (a person is considered fully vaccinated 14 days after their second dose). As such, students not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 may be unable to complete their program's required field placement component in the regularly scheduled time frame.
ACCELERATED OPTION (16 consecutive months)
If you are eager to enter the field and can study without significant breaks, we offer an accelerated stream for 16 consecutive months (four continuous semesters). Visit the
Early Childhood Education (Accelerated) (C160) program page
for more details.
FAST-TRACK – DIRECT ENTRY (10 months)
You may qualify for the Fast-Track program with a diploma or degree in a related field. Visit the
Early Childhood Education (Fast-Track) (C130) program page
for more details.
Your Field Education Options
Students in the Early Childhood Education program will complete a seven-week field placement each semester. During this time, students have the opportunity to work with children of different age groups in a variety of settings.
Field placement provides a continuum of experience that gives students the opportunity to integrate and apply theory to practice.
To support student learning outcomes and ensure you have access to facilities that model the best practices we consider essential, we operate Ontario's largest network of college-run lab school child care centres that serve over 1,000 children and their families each year. These
12 child care centres,
located across Toronto, will expose you to the kinds of environments where you will eventually work and provide valuable services to the families and communities they serve.
Please note:
Some field placement partners may require students to show proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 (a person is considered fully vaccinated 14 days after their second dose). As such, students not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 may be unable to complete their program's required field placement component in the regularly scheduled time frame.

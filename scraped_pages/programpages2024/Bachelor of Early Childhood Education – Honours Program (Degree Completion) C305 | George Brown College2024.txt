Program Description
Program Overview

$1,000 entrance scholarship and a second $1,200 entrance scholarship. Visit our entrance scholarship page for details.
Take your education and career to the next level with the
Bachelor of Early Childhood Education – Honours (Degree Completion)
program. This two-year program is designed for students with an early childhood education diploma and prepares you for leadership roles in the sector. We also offer a part-time study option for this program.
Full Description
Earn a degree in two years and prepare for progressive leadership roles in early childhood education with the Bachelor of Early Childhood Education – Honours (Degree Completion) (C305) program. This program provides a part-time study option.
Explore pedagogy and policy as they relate to the early childhood education (ECE) sector and take an in-depth look at leadership. Students take part in an industry internship* and can focus on an area of research, policy or practice.
*This is an unpaid internship and a required element of the degree program.
We believe that to be a successful leader in the ECE sector, you need to have a deep understanding of both human development and teaching and learning. You'll study each subject as it relates to early childhood education and practice.
Learn about human development from a variety of perspectives, including:
developmental psychology
population health
neurobiology
sociology
anthropology
You will also study teaching and learning through an early childhood lens. This includes a thorough overview of curriculum planning and design, as this forms the foundation of early childhood leadership.
Before completing your degree, you will have the opportunity to conduct research in an area of your choice. You will complete a research project that will ultimately support your final thesis.
Please note:
Some field placement partners may require students to show proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 (a person is considered fully vaccinated 14 days after the second dose). As such, students not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 may be unable to complete their program's required field placement component in the regularly scheduled time frame.
Your Field Education Options
To support student learning outcomes and ensure you have access to facilities that reflect the best practices that we consider essential, we own and operate Ontario's largest network of school-owned and operated child care centres that serve over 1,000 children each year. These
12 child care centres,
located across Toronto, expose you to the kinds of environments where you will eventually work and provide valuable services to the families and communities that they serve.
Field placement is offered in each year of this ECE Degree Completion program with the longest being a 14-week full-time internship that takes place between semesters 6 and 7. This internship is unpaid and may be local, elsewhere in Canada or in an international setting.
While on placement, students are expected to demonstrate their learning through exemplifying the leadership skills they have been taught in class.
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
The goal of George Brown's Honours Bachelor of Early Childhood Leadership program is to prepare early childhood professionals with program leadership knowledge and skills.
Graduates of this degree completion program will have the knowledge and practice base to influence pedagogy and curriculum. They will be prepared to move into supervisory, director and curriculum leadership positions in a full range of early childhood programs as their careers unfold or as they pursue further study.
This program prepares graduates for positions as
Registered Early Childhood Educators
, working in partnership with certified teachers in the Full-Day Early Learning programs that are replacing junior and senior kindergarten.
Graduates will be prepared to guide and lead curriculum and pedagogy in a variety of Ontario’s early childhood settings, such as:
child care centres
family drop-in programs
early intervention services
family support programs
Emerging Best Start Child and Family Centres will be integrated with existing early childhood programs, and graduates will be well-positioned to assume leadership positions within these centres.
Educational Pathways
Previous ECE degree completion graduates who wished to pursue further education have successfully gained admission to master's degree programs and/or the faculty of education at notable universities.
Toronto Metropolitan University offers several postgraduate study opportunities for graduates of the Honours Bachelor of Early Childhood Education degree program, including their

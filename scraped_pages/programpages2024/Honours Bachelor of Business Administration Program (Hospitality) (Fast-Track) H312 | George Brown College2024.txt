Continued advances in the hospitality industry have led to larger and more complex hospitality enterprises and increased demand for well-educated professionals with analytical skills capable of leading them.
The Honours Bachelor of Business Administration (Hospitality) (Fast Track) program teaches you technical skills related to the major components of a hospitality business. It prepares you for career opportunities in diverse hospitality industry sectors, including accommodations, event management, food service, sports and recreation, and travel, with training in analysis and problem-solving, critical thinking, integrated operations, customer management and international applications.
Students develop strong management and leadership abilities working on individual and group projects. And you'll gain real-world work experience with a co-op term.

"My learning experience at George Brown College has led me to new heights in my career. One of the many key attributes to my learning experience was the co-op opportunities the college has to offer in collaboration with their industry partners. I embraced the opportunity to have two co-op placements throughout my degree and both co-op opportunities further enhanced the learning experience and made it easy to get exposure to the real-life workforce.
"The faculty members at the college do not only educate but they mentor students. I can think of a number of situations in which faculty provided invaluable advice and knowledge on leadership, career advancement and industry trends. All of this support has continued to help grow my resume and personality."

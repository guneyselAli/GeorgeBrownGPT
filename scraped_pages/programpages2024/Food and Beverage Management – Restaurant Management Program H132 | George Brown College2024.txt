Program Description
Program Overview
Prepare to launch your career in restaurant management with a blend of theoretical knowledge, simulation and real-world practical experience with the
Food and Beverage Management - Restaurant Management
program. Develop your business acumen and start building your professional network in this two-year diploma program.
Full Description
Immerse yourself in a community of hospitality-focused individuals and explore the food and beverage industry with wine, mixology, entrepreneurship, and strategic restaurant management courses in the two-year
Food and Beverage Management – Restaurant Management (H132)
diploma program.
In your first year, you will gain knowledge in hotels, event planning, tourism, and food and beverages with a range of practical and theoretical courses.
During your second year, you will apply your understanding of theory with exciting learning opportunities and practical experience. You will have the chance to:
Take over
The Chefs' House
, our state-of-the-art restaurant and learning facility, where you will manage all aspects of operations, including designing and selling tickets, working with industry partners, performing cost analysis and designing the food and beverage menu in partnership with our culinary students.
Embark on an educational, virtual adventure with our
Restaurant Simulation
, where you will revitalize and transform a failing restaurant into a profitable enterprise using decision-making, management and financial planning skills.
This program allows you to switch to any of our hospitality and tourism management diploma programs by your second year, should your hospitality area of interest change. We know life can be full of unexpected events; should you not be able to complete your final year of study, our common first-year model makes you eligible to graduate with a one-year certificate in
Hospitality Services (H101)
.
Your Field Education Options
As part of your fourth semester, you will complete a 14-week industry externship with your choice of a Canadian or international placement. This opportunity will enhance your knowledge with real-world experience and help you start building your network of contacts. Completing the Food and Beverage Management program will make you the kind of multi-talented graduate the local and international food and beverage industry seeks in today’s competitive environment.
Graduates gain the skills required to be progressive leaders within the industry, enriching the experience of food and beverage guests. You will receive industry certifications in food safety, responsible alcohol beverage service, and first aid (CPR Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation). To better hone your international food and beverage management skills, you have the option of participating in an exclusive Experiential Study Tour.
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
A world of local and international opportunities awaits you when you graduate. Food and beverage management professionals may establish their career paths in restaurants, breweries, wineries, resorts, hotels, clubs, and convention centers, to name but a few. Toronto alone has more than 7,500 restaurants and 230 hotels. While many of our graduates will own and/or operate successful food and beverage restaurant operations, other students will choose to specialize in areas such as marketing, sales, human resources, finance, and consulting.

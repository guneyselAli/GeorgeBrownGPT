Program Description
Leadership Claims
This program was created in collaboration with the Ontario Centres for Learning, Research and Innovation in Long-Term Care at Baycrest and The G. Raymond Chang School of Continuing Education, Toronto Metropolitan University.
Program Overview
The
Interprofessional Complex and Long-Term Care
program is a two-semester graduate certificate that prepares graduates to lead, manage or co-ordinate a team of interprofessional health-care providers in complex and long-term care environments. This program is delivered online.
Full Description
The
Interprofessional Complex and Long-Term Care (Postgraduate) (S417)
program will prepare you to lead and co-ordinate teams in complex and long-term care environments. This program is delivered online with components available on-demand to accommodate those currently working.
During this two-semester graduate certificate program, you will learn to:
Co-ordinate and collaborate with team members across various professions in LTC by accessing on-the-job tools
Develop critical thinking and creative problem-solving skills
Use simulated team-based cases within a serious educational game platform to practise caring for patients or residents
Practise and hone skills during a 120-hour clinical placement (can be completed with an existing employer or through virtual connections)
Designed for those who want to co-ordinate or manage an interprofessional health-care team and lead initiatives aimed to improve the LTC sector
Earn college and university course credits
Although this program is delivered online and uses a virtual learning environment to support learning with realistic clinical situations, you don’t need to have superior technical skills to succeed. We’ll teach you what you need to know from a technology standpoint as you develop critical skills that will support your role as a member of an interprofessional team.
Throughout this program, you’ll develop essential skills that you can implement on the job, including:
how to work effectively as a member of an interprofessional team
an evidence-based approach to the planning and delivery of care that focuses on both the client and the family
common age-related changes that impact social, psychological and biological functions
the ability to assess and respond to a client’s health condition as it changes over time
You’ll also study the principles of interprofessional care, relational, and end-of-life care to support people in complex and long-term care environments.
Delivery of Program
This program has been designed to meet the needs of working professionals. Classes are delivered online and on-demand to allow for greater flexibility.
This program is available either full-time over two semesters, or part-time to meet your individual learning needs.
Public Health continues to recommend that people working with vulnerable communities be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  Clinical agency partners continue to require students to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to be approved to complete clinical placements within their facilities. Agencies have the right to decline the placement of students who are not fully vaccinated, and students who are not vaccinated are at risk of not being able to complete their clinical placement course requirements.
Your Field Education Options
Hands-on experience plays an important role in the Interprofessional Complex and Long-Term Care program. Students will be required to complete a 120-hour clinical placement to graduate.
If you work in the long-term care sector, you can complete the clinical placement component with your current employer.
If you are seeking an opportunity to change your career, you will be placed in a long-term care organization within your local community, or you will participate in a virtual clinical placement experience.
Career & Postgraduate Study Opportunities
Career Options
Upon graduation of George Brown's Interprofessional Complex and Long-Term Care program, you will be prepared to take on an organizing role as a co-ordinator or manager in a health-care facility that already uses or is looking to adapt to a more interprofessional approach. This would include facilities like:
long-term care homes
retirement homes
complex continuing care
rehabilitation
home health services
home visiting health services
seniors' day services
hospitals
other health care facilities
organizations that require interprofessional care knowledge and expertise
Industry
The skills you develop from the Interprofessional Complex and Long-Term Care certificate will allow you to step into a role that many institutions need, but may not be not advertising for. There is demand in institutional settings for those who have a deep understanding about how to best utilize an interprofessional approach as it relates to complex and long-term care.
Educational Pathways

Upon graduation from this program, the academic pathways available include the opportunity to apply for advanced standing for two credits in an undergraduate degree as they will have obtained two credits from Toronto Metropolitan University during the (S417) program.

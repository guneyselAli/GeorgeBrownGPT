Important information about EAP as a conditional pathway to a post-secondary program
IMPORTANT: If you are applying for the George Brown College English for Academic Purposes (EAP) program as a conditional pathway to a post-secondary program, please note the following:
You must meet eligibility requirements for the diploma/degree/postgraduate program you are applying for and submit supporting documents required. Please see the
list of supporting documents required.
We will review your application and if you are eligible, we will issue you a conditional letter of acceptance for both the EAP and the post-secondary program. This letter will assist you in applying for a Study Permit.
If you did not submit an IELTS or TOEFL or Duolingo score, you will be required to take the EAP level placement test after you arrive at George Brown College.
The results of the placement test will reflect your language ability and determine your starting level in the EAP program.
Once you know your EAP level, you will be required to contact your admissions officer at the International Centre to re-initiate your post-secondary program application because the date of your post-secondary program may have changed due to your EAP placement test result.
When you are finally accepted to the post-secondary program at this second stage, depending on availability, your post-secondary seat will be secure.
In all cases, final admission will be subject to diploma/degree/postgraduate program availability at the time of completion of EAP requirements.
Placement Test
Once students have registered, they will take a placement test to determine their level of English proficiency before beginning the EAP program. A test time will be provided upon registration.
Applicants have two options for determining level placement. Students must choose one option only and once the choice is made, it is final.
EAP applicants who do not have an IELTS (Academic), TOEFL (iBT) or Duolingo score will need to take the online EAP level placement test.
Alternatively, applicants can also be placed into an EAP level before session start based on a TOEFL (iBT), IELTS (Academic), or Duolingo score with the minimum Writing and Speaking score requirements shown below.

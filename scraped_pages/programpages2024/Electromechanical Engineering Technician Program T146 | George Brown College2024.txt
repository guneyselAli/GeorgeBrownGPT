The
Electromechanical Engineering Technician
two-year diploma program readies you for the rapidly changing demands of the North American industrial environment. Today's companies seek professionals with multidisciplinary expertise that combines electrical, mechanical, and control engineering skills, along with the installation, maintenance, and operation of increasingly sophisticated and automated equipment.
Full Description
Robotics, controls, and process automation are cornerstones of modern production facilities and automated systems. In the
Electromechanical Engineering Technician
two-year diploma program, our multi-disciplined and hands-on approach to learning culminates in a capstone project where you'll apply what you've learned to design and produce a complex, integrated, fully functional electromechanical system.
Enhance your technical skills with a strong focus on soft skills to thrive in your career and contribute effectively to teams. Learn from experienced faculty members who bring real-world insights to the classroom, ensuring you're well-prepared for the professional world.
Our industry-relevant curriculum includes hands-on learning in the college’s machine shops, electrical and industrial automation laboratories, and process controls and robotics facilities, ensuring you can move quickly and directly into the industry after graduation.
Note
: If you enrol in the program in January, you must complete semester 2 in the summer (May to August) of the same year to continue into semester 3 in the fall.

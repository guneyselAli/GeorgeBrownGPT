11,3dde356b-fe14-4f80-a2bc-721894bf74d4," The college offers a Power Engineering Technology diploma program. In the first two years, students gain experience with power and control systems including electric motors, controls, PLCs, generators, transformers, electrical CAD, and electrical safety code. In the third year, students continue with advanced courses in electrical installations, power transmission and distribution, power quality, electrical protection and control, project management, automation systems, and control applications.

Graduating students perform technological functions related to power and control systems, energy, robotics and automation, manufacturing, processing, and computer industries. This work is primarily in support of research, technology installation, problem-solving, product development, and design at a recognized technologist level.

Students will complete two mandatory co-op semesters. The first co-op experience takes place between semesters 4 and 5, and the second co-op experience takes place between semesters 5 and 6.

Graduates will be in high demand for their cross-disciplinary skills in utilities, power generation and distribution, robotics and automation, computer industry, manufacturing industry, renewable energy industries.

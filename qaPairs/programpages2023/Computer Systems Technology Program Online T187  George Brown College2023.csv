It consists of two optional specializations in the third year: Networking and Systems. Both specializations include core courses on infrastructure virtualization, cloud computing, network security, voice-over-IP (VoIP), wireless LANs, mail server administration, content management systems, database administration, and computer security. Students will gain hands-on experience using up-to-date networking, wireless, radio frequency, VoIP, and security lab equipment.

In the third year of the program, students will be involved in real-life projects or case studies. These may be completed independently, with industry partners, or with George Brown's Office of Research and Innovation. Students have recently helped develop IT solutions for various well-known companies in the Greater Toronto Area, including Bell Mobility, Rogers Communications, Cogeco Data Systems, and many others.

The program covers all courses of the official Cisco CCNA Routing & Switching curriculum and prepares students to write several other examinations leading to industry certifications, such as the Certified Wireless Network Administrator (CWNA) and Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate. Students starting in January (winter term) will be required to attend classes during the summer months (May to August).

This is an online-only program for domestic students. However, regular in-person delivery and international eligibility are available through the Computer Systems Technology (T147) program.

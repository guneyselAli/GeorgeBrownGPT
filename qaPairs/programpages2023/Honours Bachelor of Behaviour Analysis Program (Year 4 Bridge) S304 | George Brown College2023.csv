16,1befeec7-49eb-4eb7-8669-55b0a8f92a8a," The text describes an accelerated degree program in Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) offered by the college. The program is open to students who have completed a three-year advanced behavioral science technology program. The program duration includes a bridge semester from January to April, followed by an unpaid internship from September to December, and finally, the final term from January to April. The primary focus of the program is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of behavioural psychology and Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA).

ABA is described as a scientific approach to the treatment and understanding of human behaviour that can be applied to various populations, including those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), brain injury, dementia, developmental disabilities, addiction, and mental health disorders.

The ABA approach involves three main components: conducting a complete behavioural assessment, using the results of the assessment to develop an effective plan, and ongoing evaluation of components one and two. Students will learn various interview and observational techniques for assessing behaviour, behavioral and cognitive-behavioral techniques for changing behavior, and how to measure the effectiveness of interventions.

The research component is a crucial aspect of the program, with students preparing an Applied Research Proposal prior to conducting their research during the fall internship (September to December) and writing a research thesis before graduating.

ABA is described as a scientific approach to the treatment and understanding of human behaviour that can be applied to various populations, including those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), brain injury, dementia, developmental disabilities, addiction, and mental health disorders.

The ABA approach involves three main components: conducting a complete behavioural assessment, using the results of the assessment to develop an effective plan, and ongoing evaluation of components one and two. Students will learn various interview and observational techniques for assessing behaviour, behavioral and cognitive-behavioral techniques for changing behavior, and how to measure the effectiveness of interventions.

The research component is a crucial aspect of the program, with students preparing an Applied Research Proposal prior to conducting their research during the fall internship (September to December) and writing a research thesis before graduating. Faculty support will be provided throughout the process. The Association for Behaviour Analysis International has verified the course sequence of the program.",8.

11,d74c20b9-b038-4fee-9849-10754e36bfd0," The text describes a Distance Education program for becoming a PLC Technician offered by the college. The program does not require students to physically attend the college but can be completed at home using an interactive learning package. The learning materials include 19 courses (modules) with text, audio, 2D and 3D animations, computer-based testing, and PLCLogix 500 simulation software.

The program is open for enrollment throughout the year, and students can complete the modules at their own pace. The typical completion time is 32 weeks, but there are no time limits. To be eligible for the program, one needs an Ontario Secondary School Diploma (or equivalent) or mature student status.

The program prepares students to work in industrial automation and control fields where they can install, repair, and maintain various electrical control systems and write PLC programs. Career opportunities include roles as PLC technicians, working with I/O networks, data highways, variable speed drives, process control equipment, and robotics, or in the industrial engineering field designing and implementing PLC control systems.

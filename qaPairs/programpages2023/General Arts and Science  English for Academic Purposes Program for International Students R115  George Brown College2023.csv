The minimum writing and speaking score requirements for each test are listed in the text. Final admission to post-secondary programs is subject to availability at the time of completion of EAP requirements. Placement tests are provided upon registration. Students must choose one option only and once the choice is made, it's final.

- IELTS: overall score of 105+, writing & speaking scores of 8.0-9.1

The applicants need to contact their admissions officer at the International Centre once they know their EAP level and post-secondary program application dates may have changed due to their EAP placement test result.

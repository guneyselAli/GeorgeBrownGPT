14,f40a4cc9-486e-47be-95ff-e7ca555255e5," The text provides information about Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA), a field of study used to modify behavior in a desirable way, and the training and education provided by a college in Toronto for over 15 years. ABA is an effective practice used with populations such as those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), brain injury, dementia, developmental disabilities, addiction, and mental health disorders.

The information on what students will be studying includes:
- Applied behaviour analysis is a scientific approach to the treatment and understanding of human behaviour.
- The ABA approach involves three main components: behavioral assessment, developing an effective plan, and ongoing evaluation.
- Students will learn various interview and observational techniques for gaining an understanding of behavior and developing an effective treatment strategy.
- They will also learn a variety of behavioral and cognitive behavioral techniques to change behavior.
- A foundational aspect of the degree lies with the research component of the program, which begins in years 1 and 2 and culminates in a capstone project conducted during the fourth year.
- The Association for Behaviour Analysis International has verified certain courses towards the coursework requirements for eligibility to take the Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst® examination.

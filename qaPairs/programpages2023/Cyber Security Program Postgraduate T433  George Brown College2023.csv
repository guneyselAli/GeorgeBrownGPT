In the first semester, students learn the fundamentals of cyber security and the differences between it and hacking, focusing on primary attack surfaces, methods for compromising them, and vulnerability mitigation.

In the third semester, advanced techniques in ethical hacking and incident response are covered, and a capstone group project offers an opportunity to showcase skills in digital forensics and incident response management, ethical hacking and malware analysis, security training delivery, cryptography application, and other non-technical skills such as analytical thinking, communication, project management, and interpersonal skills.

The program prepares students to help defend organizations against various cyber threats including malware, network attacks, and data compromise. Students will have the ability to monitor, assess, and evaluate security risks and threats, develop contingency planning, and create policies and procedures for mitigating risks.

The full-time program requires learners to attend classes mostly in late afternoons and evenings during the week and all day Saturday. Students need a personal laptop with 8GB RAM (16GB recommended), support for virtualization, a 256 GB SSD hard drive (500+ GB is optimal), a 2TB external hard drive, webcam + mic, and consistent access to a reliable high-speed internet connection.

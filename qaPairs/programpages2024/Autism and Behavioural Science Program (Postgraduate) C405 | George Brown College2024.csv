Field education may require travel within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), potentially to locations as far east as Oshawa, west as Burlington, and north as Vaughan.

Recommended skills and aptitudes for this career path include being caring, tenacious, analytic, and detail-oriented. The program features full-time and part-time faculty with extensive experience in ABA, IBI, and ASD. George Brown has well-established relationships with agencies providing services for individuals with autism.

During semester 1, students have a three-week field placement experience to observe an individual with autism at an agency partner. In semester 2, the seven-week field placement requires students to identify a target behaviour and develop a treatment plan accordingly.

Graduates of George Brown's Autism and Behavioural Science program can find employment as instructor-therapists in agencies offering ABA for children with autism spectrum disorder, schools, and private family settings. Opportunities for advancement include supervisory or consultant roles. Previous education at the diploma or degree level may lead to other career opportunities such as resource teacher or educational assistant.

The program utilizes the simulator PLCLogix 5000 and Studio 5000/Rockwell RSLogix 5000 software for comprehensive coverage of tag-based PLC programming. The simulation software includes over 250 pre-built lab projects and 10 manufacturing environments.

The program is open for enrolment at any time, with no set completion time and flexible pacing. Students will use an interactive learning package to complete modules containing text, audio, 2D and 3D animations, computer-based testing, and PLCLogix 5000 simulation software. Each module is accompanied by a final exam taken online (computer-based testing).

Prerequisites include an Ontario Secondary School Diploma or equivalent, or mature student status. Minimum computer requirements are an Intel Core i3, i5, i7, AMD Ryzen 3, 5, 7 processor or equivalent, 4GB RAM, 500MB of available disk space, Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11 operating system, and internet access with an email account.

Graduates of any courses listed on PMI's Registered Education Provider portal will meet the education requirements to apply for the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) or Project Management Professional (PMP) certification.

The B156 program at George Brown College requires students to complete a total of 36 courses: 32 mandatory courses, 2 business electives, and 2 general education electives. Students may be required to take certain prerequisite courses such as COMM 1000 (Introduction to College Communication) or MATH 1027 (Business Math with Remediation), which do not count toward the 36 courses required for graduation and will incur additional charges.

Students must complete three general education courses from at least two of the following categories: Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities, or Science and Technology. Students are also required to make up any failed or dropped courses before they can graduate. Some make-up classes may be offered through Continuing Education during the day or in the evening, but students should check with the Business Office staff to ensure that these courses are equivalent to those taught in the full-time program and to check for availability.

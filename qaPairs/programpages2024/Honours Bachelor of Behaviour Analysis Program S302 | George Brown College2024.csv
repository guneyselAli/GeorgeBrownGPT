ABA can be applied to various populations including those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), brain injury, dementia, developmental disabilities, addiction, and mental health disorders.

The degree program consists of three main components:
1. Conducting a complete behavioral assessment using interview and observational techniques.
2. Developing an effective plan based on the results of the assessment to reduce problem behaviors and develop skills.
3. Ongoing evaluation of components one and two.

The degree program also includes a research component where students prepare for their capstone project from years 1-3, and conduct the actual research during their fourth year.

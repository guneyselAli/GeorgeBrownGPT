11,c7923759-0474-493e-b422-8d6983cc3439," The text provides information about different types of welding processes taught in a college program, which includes Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW), Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), Plasma Arc and Oxyfuel Cutting, and Fabrication. SMAW uses a consumable electrode covered with flux, is primary in maintenance and repair industry, used for welding iron and steel, and can also be used for alloys. GMAW uses electricity to melt and join pieces of metal together, is easy to learn, and can be used to weld various metals such as carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, magnesium, copper, bronze, etc. GTAW uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode with inert gas protection for welding stainless steel and non-ferrous metals like aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. Plasma Arc and Oxyfuel Cutting use compressed gas or fuel gases combined with oxygen to cut metals primarily mild steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. Fabrication is the building of metal structures by cutting, bending, and assembling processes.

Graduates of the program have increased marketability and knowledge of the welding trade and provide a good understanding of safety practices relevant to the work performed. Welders are always in demand in the manufacturing industry of Ontario due to their importance to the manufacturing process. The program offers an opportunity for students to challenge the shielded metal arc weld test, in accordance with CSA W47.1/W59 standards, at extra cost for positions of their choosing through the Canadian Welders Bureau.

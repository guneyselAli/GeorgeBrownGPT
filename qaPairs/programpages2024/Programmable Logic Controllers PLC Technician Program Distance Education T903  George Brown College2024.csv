11,f98a4789-26c1-4322-bbcc-88e6632b70bc," The PLC Technician Certificate program is an introductory course focusing on practical applications of PLCs, with 19 modules in a web-based downloadable file format. The learning materials include text, audio, 2D and 3D animations, computer-based testing, and PLCLogix 500 simulation software. The interactive PLCLogix 500 simulation software converts a computer into a virtual PLC and allows running, verifying, and debugging ladder logic programs based on Rockwell RSLogix 500 format. This program helps users become familiar with various features of Rockwell PLCs, such as timers, counters, sequencers, and math functions.

The typical completion time for the program is 32 weeks, but there are no set time limits. To enroll, students need an Ontario Secondary School Diploma or equivalent or mature student status; previous PLC experience is helpful but not necessary. The minimum computer requirements include an Intel or AMD processor, 4GB RAM, 500 MB of available disk space, and a Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11 operating system with internet access and an email account.

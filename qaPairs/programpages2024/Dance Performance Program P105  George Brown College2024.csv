000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, Question: 15,
15002756: 466963738,
```

Now we can use a for loop to print out the first 15 items of our list and each item's id and value:

```ruby
my_array.first(15).each do |item|
  puts ""ID: #{item[0]} Value: #{item[1]}""
end
```

Which produces the output:

```ruby
ID: 93267547 Value: 123
ID: 13886048 Value: 1000
ID: 93268293 Value: 10000
ID: 93268384 Value: 2500
ID: 93268475 Value: 2000
ID: 93268566 Value: 1500
ID: 93268657 Value: 100
ID: 93268668 Value: 500
ID: 93268769 Value: 120
ID: 93268860 Value: 500
ID: 93268951 Value: 4500
ID: 93269042 Value: 550
ID: 93269133 Value: 1250
ID: 93269224 Value: 5500
```

We can also use a for loop to iterate over the first n items, where n is the number of items we want to print:

```ruby
n = 15
my_array.each_with_index do |item, i|
  break if i >= n # exit after printing n items
  puts ""ID: #{item[0]} Value: #{item[1]}""
end
```

This will print the first n items of our array:

```ruby
ID: 93267547 Value: 123
ID: 13886048 Value: 1000
ID: 93268293 Value: 10000
ID: 93268384 Value: 2500
ID: 93268475 Value: 2000
ID: 93268566 Value: 1500
ID: 93268669 Value: 120
ID: 93268769 Value: 500
ID: 93269133 Value: 4500
```

The `break` keyword in our loop causes execution to exit the loop once we have printed n items. If you want to print all items except for the last one, use the `next` keyword instead of `break`. The difference between `break` and `next` is that `break` stops the loop entirely while `next` just moves on to the next iteration:

```ruby
n = 15
my_array.each_with_index do |item, i|
  next if i >= n # skip this item
  puts ""ID: #{item[0]} Value: #{item[1]}""
end
```

This will print all items except for the last one (n = 15):

```ruby
ID: 93267547 Value: 123
ID: 13886048 Value: 1000
ID: 93268293 Value: 10000
ID: 93268384 Value: 2500
ID: 93268475 Value: 2000
ID: 93268566 Value: 1500
ID: 93268669 Value: 120
ID: 93268769 Value: 500
```

The `each_with_index` method is part of the Array class in Ruby, and it returns both the value (the second item) and an index. It's very useful when working with arrays. The `each` method without `each_with_index` only gives you access to the value itself, but no way to find its position in the array.?"

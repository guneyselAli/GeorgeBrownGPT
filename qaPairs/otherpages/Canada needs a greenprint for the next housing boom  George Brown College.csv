The text highlights the need for a new ""greenprint"" to change building design, construction, renovation, and heating methods. Progress is being made with sustainable building approaches and financial mechanisms.

First, powering homes must be addressed. Canada relies on natural gas but heat pumps are a low-emissions alternative that is not yet cost effective for Canadians. Regulations coming this summer will change this. However, electrifying buildings in the wrong way could lead to dramatic electricity rate increases for struggling Canadians. Every province must find ways to generate and transmit more electricity at lower costs and with fewer emissions.

Second, materials used to build buildings, such as cement, steel, account for 30% of a building's overall carbon footprint and can add nearly two decades of emissions. Canada is among the world leaders in green steel and other sustainable construction materials. A new wave of mass timber is mentioned as an option.

0,26c7d3e2-ff75-4567-b7f5-f4fe93f49d5a," George Brown College has received a total of almost $4.2M in funding over two years from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council’s Applied Research and Technology Partnership (ARTP) program. The funding will support three projects, one of which is a collaboration between George Brown's Product Development Exchange (PDx) and Fashion Exchange (FX) focused on product and process innovation. The industries primarily targeted are electromechanical engineering and textile, apparel design and manufacturing sectors. Dr. Krista Holmes, Associ vice-president of Research and Innovation at George Brown, mentioned the industries have been disrupted by globalization, digitization, new technologies and COVID-19, and they're eager to embrace new technologies and adapt to sustainability standards but are limited by a lack of in-house resources for research activities. George Brown will collaborate on two additional ARTP initiatives: the Canadian Materials and Circular Economy Syndicate (CMCES) led by Lambton College, and SONAMI — a Niagara College-led network of nine postsecondary institutions designed to support SMEs in the manufacturing sector across Southern Ontario.

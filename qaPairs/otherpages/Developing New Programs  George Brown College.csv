2. NPAC meeting #2: If a proposal receives approval to proceed to program design, the necessary support from the Office of Academic Excellence is scheduled, and programs should consider developing their curriculum.

NPAC meeting #3 takes place after the completion of sections 1-18 in the NPAP proposal to ensure that all programs have enacted their proposed plans during the development process.

The application process for both the Clinical Methods Program and the Technicians Program is done through the Ontario College's Application Service (OCAS). The deadline for applying for the September 2023 start date is February 1st, 2024. Applicants are encouraged to apply earlier than the deadline.

For the Clinical Methods Program, the George Brown College Admissions Department checks if the candidate meets the academic requirements to apply to the program. Those who meet the academic requirements have their names passed on to the program, which then arranges an admissions test for them.

For the Technicians Program, those who are deemed academically acceptable by the College Admissions Department will be scheduled by the faculty office for testing involving an online admissions test covering subjects such as English, physics, anatomy, and workshop awareness. This information can be found on the detailed application process information for each program.

Information sessions for both programs occur twice a year, normally in late November and January. Interested individuals can register for these sessions by visiting the Technician program Info Session registration or Clinical Methods program Info Session registration links.",.?

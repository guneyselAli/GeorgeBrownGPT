4. ADA compliance (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0): The website does not appear to be fully compliant with W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0). There are instances of missing alternative text for images, inconsistent use of headings and labels, and some links lacking proper context or descriptive labels.
